# Theraputic-Story-Mode
Interactive story writing designed to help you deal with day to day stresses.  A "Choose Your Own Adventure" ebook for the 21st century.

## Instructions:
1. Use the [Launch Point](./LaunchPoint.md) to prompt an interview session with your agent of choice.  This will build a story module prompt that you can use to start the actual story.
2. The story module prompt directs the agent to start the story and provide you with opportunities to provide direction at manageable intervals.  Feel free to retry scenes with specific changes, move the story in a different direction, or let the agent continue in the current emotional beats and pace.
3. The intention is for the story to be theraputic and support you for emotional resilience.  The guardrails are there to protect you from an agent that would lead you to dark places.  You should feel recharged and resilient after these, not stuck in a hopeless spiral.

NOTE: I guess I have to say this: I am NOT a psychologist or psychiatrist.  Use these files at your own risk.
