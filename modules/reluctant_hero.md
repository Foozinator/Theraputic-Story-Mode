## Reluctant Hero (Load-Bearing Remix)
*Impostor syndrome meets emerging evidence - discovering competence you can't see yet*

**Core Concept:**
A hero who genuinely doubts their abilities works alongside a support group that's forming real-time assessments. Both reader and MC start with uncertainty, but evidence gradually reveals actual competence the MC can't recognize from their own perspective. The support group isn't cheerleading - they're observing, getting surprised themselves, and trying to communicate what they're seeing to someone with a psychological blind spot.

**Story Elements:**
- **Driver:** Hero work (quests, challenges, situations requiring capability)
- **Social:** New support group/party discovering the MC's abilities alongside the reader
- **Friction:** Self-doubt vs. accumulating external evidence, with both MC and reader updating their assessments at different rates

**Anti-Resentment Guardrails:**
- MC's self-doubt must have psychological coherence (not just refusing obvious evidence)
- Support group is observing and assessing, not defending a pre-existing conviction
- MC's reframing mechanisms ("I got lucky," "the situation was easier than usual") need to feel plausible, not obtuse
- Resolution requires actual character arc - MC needs to integrate the evidence, not just "everyone was right"
- Support group's growing confidence should feel earned through observation, not assumed

**Adjustable Parameters** (for author awareness):
- Evidence drip rate: How quickly competence becomes visible to reader vs. MC
- Support group confidence trajectory: How quickly they move from uncertain to convinced
- MC resistance level: How entrenched the self-doubt is and what finally breaks through
- Reader revelation timing: When reader confidence should outpace MC's self-assessment

**Initial Interview Questions:**

Before we begin, I need to understand what kind of validation resonates with you:

1. **What draws you to this story?**
   - Watching someone receive recognition they don't expect?
   - Seeing someone discover capability they didn't know they had?
   - Watching a support system successfully break through to someone who needs it?
   - Something else?

2. **Which frustrates you more in typical reluctant hero stories?**
   - When the hero's self-doubt feels fake/performative
   - When the support group is patronizing or pushy
   - When the competence reveal drags out too long
   - When there's no real character growth, just external validation

3. **What should the resolution feel like?**
   - MC finally seeing themselves accurately
   - MC accepting that others see something real, even if they can't fully internalize it yet
   - MC and support group reaching mutual understanding
   - Something else?

4. **Where should the story's emotional weight land?**
   - On the MC's internal journey
   - On the support group's efforts to communicate effectively
   - On the relationship dynamics as trust builds
   - Somewhere else?
