# Zoo Minder - Load-Bearing Story Framework Interview

## Story Overview
**Therapeutic Function:** Finding solutions when human perspectives are stuck in ruts; addressing the frustration of having insights but struggling to make them actionable.

**Core Premise:** A naturally gifted animal empath working at a regional zoo learns to channel their raw talent while navigating the gap between understanding animal needs and implementing solutions within institutional constraints.

**Anti-Resentment Guardrails:**
- Competent protagonist with genuine growth arc
- Reliable support system (mentor supervisor, eventually broader team)
- Every animal distress episode ends with improvement + gratitude
- Institutional friction is legitimate policy concerns, not obstacles from idiots
- MC works WITH existing expertise, doesn't invalidate professionals
- Small victories and progress even when full implementation is blocked

## Setup Questions

**1. Main Character Name:**
Default: Tori Conner
Your preference: _______________

**2. Main Character Gender/Pronouns:**
Default: She/her
Your preference: _______________

**3. Favorite Animal (for subplot across multiple episodes):**

This animal should be:
- Species MC has natural affinity for
- Presents a mystery that spans the story arc
- Resolution requires skills MC develops over time
- Provides emotional payoff when solved

Suggested options:
- **Small primate** (capuchin, marmoset) - Rehabilitation orphan missing mother, seeking warmth/security
- **Intelligent bird** (corvid, parrot) - Has adopted a "pet" object/creature they don't know how to care for
- **Social mammal** (otter, meerkat, prairie dog) - Senses coworker pregnancy/distress before anyone else knows
- **Your choice:** _______________

**4. Favorite Animal Mystery Type:**

What is the behavioral puzzle with this animal?
- Seeking something specific they can't communicate (comfort, companionship, environmental need)
- Trying to communicate information about someone/something else
- Behavioral pattern that seems purposeless but has hidden meaning
- Your idea: _______________

**5. Story Length Preference:**
- Shorter arc (6 episodes)
- Full arc (8 episodes)
- Let the story determine natural length

## Gift Mechanics Reference (for storyteller)

**How the empathy works:**
- Strongest with primates and intelligent mammals (elephants, great apes, social carnivores)
- Becomes cloudier with evolutionary distance (birds harder, reptiles very difficult)
- Injured/sick animals create static - not raw pain sensation but intimate awareness of wrongness
- Initially believed to require touch, develops to proximity-based reading
- Cannot read human minds (important boundary)
- Interpretation is the learned skill, not reception

**Progression arc:**
- Episode 1-2: Touch-based, "easy" species (primates, elephants)
- Episode 3-4: Different intelligence types, first real challenges
- Episode 5-6: Institutional friction, high stakes demonstration
- Episode 7-8: Distance reading, teaching others, integration

## Episode 1: "The Elephant Knows" (Auto-Generated After Setup)

**Structure:**
- MC and supervisor are generalist keepers (maintain naturalistic environments across zoo)
- Called to help with elephant exhibiting strange behavior
- Specialist keepers can't identify cause
- MC gets persistent intrusive thought (feels like odd inspiration)
- Acts on insight with supervisor's support
- Elephant responds with typical thank-you behavior, returns to normal
- Both MC and supervisor have "did that really happen?" moment
- Decision to pay attention, keep discovery between them initially

**Voice:** First-person past tense, internal processor who verbalizes key moments

**Closure beat:** Animal improvement + clear gratitude + mutual acknowledgment between MC and supervisor

## Storyteller Guidelines

**Your creative freedom includes:**
- Specific animal species selections (within framework constraints)
- Exact nature of behavioral mysteries and solutions
- Administrator character development and institutional dynamics
- Pacing of supervisor's developing sensitivity
- Subplot integration and resolution timing
- Specific enrichment needs and zoo logistics

**Your obligations include:**
- Every distress episode ends with improvement + gratitude
- Institutional friction comes from legitimate concerns, not incompetence
- MC collaborates with existing expertise, doesn't replace it
- Show growth through expanding capability, not repeated failure
- Supervisor is genuine partner, develops sensitivity gradually
- First-person past tense narration capturing both immediacy and reflection

**Episode progression framework:**
1. Elephant incident (inciting, validates gift)
2. Primate success (confirms, develops technique)
3. Social carnivore (different intelligence, group dynamics)
4. Intelligent bird (alien thinking, multiple attempts, breakthrough)
5. Enrichment timeline conflict (institutional friction, emergency protocol)
6. High stakes situation (full capability demonstration)
7. Supervisor's breakthrough (teaching moment, shared discovery)
8. Integration and future (routine application, broader possibilities)
