## Vignette One: Heron-7

### Patient Perspective

The nav computer hiccupped, then died completely.

Jalen stared at the blank screen for three seconds that felt like thirty, running through the reboot sequence automatically. Nothing. The emergency systems kicked in—life support stable, communications active, propulsion responding to manual—but without navigation, he was flying blind through a debris field at 15,000 meters per second relative to the fleet.

"Mayday, mayday, this is shuttle Heron-7, I've lost navigation and I'm—" He checked the analog instruments, the ones nobody used anymore except in sims. "I'm approximately forty klicks spinward of the *Calypso*, drifting through the outer debris perimeter. Life support is good, comms are good, but I cannot navigate. Repeat, I cannot navigate."

The response came faster than he expected. A woman's voice, calm as if she were ordering coffee.

"Heron-7, this is Rescue Engineer Reyes inbound on your position. I'm seeing you on our scopes. You're not drifting—you're on a pretty stable vector, actually. You've got about eighteen minutes before your path intersects with something that'll ruin your whole day, so let's not waste time panicking. You with me?"

Jalen's hands were shaking. Eighteen minutes. "Yeah. Yeah, I'm with you."

"Good. I'm Maya. You can call me that or you can call me 'that crazy person who's about to fly way too close to my shuttle,' but Maya's shorter. What's your name?"

"Jalen. Jalen Obi."

"Nice to meet you, Jalen. Terrible circumstances, but we'll fix that. I need you to do something for me—kill your main engine. You're burning fuel for no reason and it's making my approach math annoying."

He complied, fingers fumbling across the manual controls. The subtle vibration ceased.

"Perfect. Now, I know you can't see it, but I'm about six hundred meters behind you and closing. When I get close enough, I'm going to latch onto your hull with a magnetic grapple and we're going to play 'follow the leader' out of this debris field. The ride might get a little bumpy when I start maneuvering, but your shuttle's rated for it. You just sit tight and try not to think about the fact that we're doing this without your nav computer."

"That's... not helping."

A laugh. Actual genuine amusement. "Yeah, sorry. Ari says I need to work on my bedside manner. Tell you what—you ever do any sailing? Like, old Earth, wind and water sailing?"

What kind of question was that? "Uh. No?"

"Shame. There's this thing experienced sailors say: 'Slow is fast.' Means if you rush, you make mistakes, and mistakes cost you way more time than just doing it right the first time. That's what we're doing here. I could blast in, grab you, and yank us both out of here in about four minutes, but then we'd both probably be dead. So instead, we're going to take our time, do it right, and you're going to be buying drinks in the crew lounge in about forty-five minutes. Sound good?"

The casualness of it should have been infuriating. Instead, Jalen found himself breathing a little easier. "Yeah. Yeah, okay."

"There we go. Stand by for grapple contact. This part's going to clunk pretty good, but it's supposed to."

Three seconds later, his shuttle shuddered as something locked onto the hull with a deep, resonant *thunk* that he felt in his chest.

"Got you," Maya said. "Now let's get you home."

* * *

The docking bay of the *Calypso* had never looked so good.

Jalen felt the gentle deceleration as Maya brought both shuttles in on her grapple, matching the rotation of the bay with the kind of precision that made it look effortless. Through his viewport, he could see the deck crew already moving into position, their practiced movements suggesting this wasn't their first rodeo with a towed shuttle.

"Alright Jalen, we're coming in smooth. Your shuttle's going to touch down first, then I'll release and set down next to you. Don't try to exit until the bay re-pressurizes—I know you know that, but people get excited and do dumb things when they're relieved to be alive."

"Copy that." His voice sounded steadier now. Almost normal.

The shuttle touched down with barely a bump. Maya's voice came through one last time: "Welcome home. Medical's going to want to check you over—standard procedure, nothing personal. You didn't hit your head or anything during all this, did you?"

"No, I'm good. Just... shaken up."

"That's allowed. Ari's already logged the incident report. Your nav computer failure is getting flagged for the maintenance chief—looks like a cascading power regulation issue, not something you could have prevented. So don't beat yourself up about it."

The bay finished pressurizing. Jalen popped the hatch and climbed out on legs that felt slightly wobbly. The deck crew was already swarming his shuttle, running diagnostics and safety checks.

Maya's rescue craft settled onto the deck twenty meters away—smaller than he'd expected, bristling with equipment and grapple arms that looked jury-rigged but functional. The cockpit canopy slid open and she emerged: average height, dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, wearing a flight suit that had seen better days. She moved with the easy confidence of someone who'd done this a hundred times.

She caught his eye and gave him a casual wave, then turned to confer with one of the deck crew, already moving on to whatever came next.

Jalen realized he was still standing there, staring. A medical tech appeared at his elbow. "Pilot Obi? If you'll come with me, we'll get you checked out."

He followed, glancing back once. Maya was laughing at something the deck chief had said, completely relaxed, like she hadn't just threaded two spacecraft through a debris field in tandem.

*Slow is fast*, he thought. And apparently, when you did it right, it looked easy.

* * *

## Vignette Two: Prometheus

### Patient Perspective

Commander Yuki Tanaka had been in worse situations. Not many, granted, but some.

The cargo hauler *Prometheus* had taken a glancing hit from micrometeorite debris—unlucky trajectory, statistical improbability, all the things that didn't matter when you were venting atmosphere from a hull breach and your co-pilot was unconscious with a head wound. She'd gotten them both into emergency suits, sealed off the damaged sections, and sent the distress call before the backup power started flickering.

Now she sat in the dimming cockpit, one hand on Chen's pulse point through his suit glove, watching her HUD count down their remaining air supply. Forty-two minutes. Plenty of time. Probably.

"Prometheus, this is Rescue Engineer Reyes. I'm inbound with medical support. What's your status?"

Yuki kept her voice level. "Two crew, both suited. Co-pilot is unconscious, head trauma, stable vitals. I've sealed off the main hull breach but we're on emergency power and losing it. Main engines are offline."

"Copy that. I'm eight minutes out. How's your air supply?"

"Forty-one minutes on my counter."

"Plenty of time. Your co-pilot—can you describe the injury?"

Yuki glanced at Chen. Blood had stopped seeping from the gash across his forehead, which was either good or very bad. "Blunt force trauma, looks like he hit the console during decompression. Three-inch laceration, stopped bleeding. He's been unconscious for about six minutes now."

"Okay. Keep monitoring his breathing. If it changes, let me know immediately. I'm going to come alongside and dock with your emergency airlock—your ship's tumbling a bit, so this might take a few extra minutes to match rotation, but we'll get there."

A few extra minutes. Yuki did the math automatically. Still well within their air supply. "Understood."

"Commander, I know this is a lot, but I need you to stay focused for me. When I dock, I'm going to need your help getting your co-pilot through the airlock. Can you manage that?"

"Yes." No hesitation. Yuki had carried Chen through worse.

"Perfect. Stand by."

The minutes ticked past. Through the viewport, Yuki could see the debris field glittering in the distant starlight, fragments of whatever had spawned the micrometeorite that had ruined their day. The *Prometheus* continued its slow, nauseating tumble.

"Prometheus, coming alongside now. You might feel some vibration as I match your rotation."

A subtle shift in the tumble pattern. Then steadier. Smoother.

"Docking clamps engaging in three... two... one..."

The *clunk* of contact resonated through the hull. Solid. Secure.

"We're locked. Pressurizing the connection now. Should have green lights in about ninety seconds."

Yuki allowed herself one full breath of relief. They were going to be okay.

"Airlock shows green," Maya's voice came through, still that same unflappable calm. "I'm coming through. Get ready to help me with your co-pilot."

The interior hatch cycled open. Maya appeared in a sleeker emergency suit than standard issue, a medical kit already in hand. She moved immediately to Chen, checking his pupils with a small light, fingers on his pulse.

"Good job keeping him stable. Let's get him onto my ship—I've got better medical equipment and more space to work. You take his legs, I've got his shoulders."

They maneuvered Chen through the airlock carefully, Yuki's muscles burning from the effort in the confined space. Maya's rescue craft was cramped but organized, everything secured and labeled.

"Lay him here. Perfect." Maya was already pulling out a scanner, running it over Chen's head. "Concussion, some swelling, but nothing catastrophic. He's going to have a hell of a headache when he wakes up, but he'll be fine."

Yuki felt something unknot in her chest. "Thank you."

"You did the hard part. Now sit down and breathe for a minute. We're heading back to the *Calypso*, ETA twenty-three minutes."

The rescue craft detached smoothly, and Yuki felt the gentle acceleration as Maya began their journey back. Through the viewport, she watched the *Prometheus* drift away, dark and broken.

"Your ship's recoverable," Maya said, as if reading her mind. "Salvage team will tow it in once we're clear. You'll be flying her again in a week, two tops."

Yuki nodded, not trusting her voice.

"Commander?" Maya's voice was gentler now. "You did good. Really good. A lot of people would have panicked in your situation."

"I've had good training."

"Training gets you through the checklist. What you did—keeping your co-pilot alive, staying calm, giving me clear information—that's character. Ari agrees with me, by the way. And she's usually pretty stingy with compliments."

Despite everything, Yuki almost smiled. "Tell Ari thank you."

"She heard you. She says you're welcome."

The rest of the flight passed in comfortable silence, Yuki watching Chen's steady breathing and letting herself finally believe they were safe.

* * *

### Maya's Perspective

"Eight minutes out" was optimistic, and Ari knew it.

Maya ran the approach calculations again, watching the *Prometheus* tumble through the debris field like a broken toy. The rotation was irregular—probably a thruster stuck open somewhere, venting propellant in uneven bursts.

"Commander Tanaka sounds solid," Ari said through the neural link, her voice clear in Maya's head even though the cockpit was silent. "Vitals on both crew are stable from what I'm reading on their suit telemetry."

"Yeah, she's keeping it together." Maya adjusted her approach vector, threading between two larger debris fragments. "But that tumble is going to make docking interesting. I'm seeing... what, about forty-degree axis variation?"

"Forty-two point three. And it's not consistent. Something's definitely venting."

Maya pulled up the *Prometheus*'s schematics on her HUD. Cargo hauler, older model, built solid but not fancy. The emergency airlock was port-side amidships, currently rotating past her field of view every eighteen seconds.

"Okay. I can match rotation, but it's going to take some finesse. Let's start the approach."

She brought the rescue craft in slowly, careful to stay out of the debris paths. The *Prometheus* spun lazily before her, its emergency lights strobing in the darkness.

"Matching rotation in three... two..."

The proximity alert screamed.

Maya's hands moved before her conscious mind registered the threat—a chunk of debris, maybe half a meter across, tumbling directly into her approach path. She fired the lateral thrusters hard, felt the G-force slam her sideways in her harness.

"Fuck," she said conversationally.

"Debris cleared by eight meters," Ari reported. "That wasn't on our initial scan."

"Yeah, this field is more active than the long-range showed. Lovely." Maya steadied the craft, found her approach vector again. Her heart rate had barely spiked—this was well within parameters, just annoying. "How's our fuel looking?"

"Sixty-three percent. Still comfortable, but not generous."

"Copy that." She brought them back into position, this time with one eye on the active debris tracking. The *Prometheus* continued its irregular spin. "Alright, second try. Matching rotation now."

The rescue craft's thrusters fired in carefully timed bursts, synchronizing with the cargo hauler's tumble. Maya felt it in her bones when the rotation matched—that subtle shift from fighting the movement to flowing with it.

"Good lock. Moving to dock."

She brought them in slowly, carefully, aware that Commander Tanaka was probably watching their approach and wondering why it was taking so long. Better slow than dead.

The docking clamps extended. Almost there.

The magnetic grapple on her portside arm flickered red.

"Ari, I'm showing grapple failure on port mag."

"Confirmed. Power surge from that debris avoidance maneuver. The regulator's trying to reset but it's not catching."

Maya's mind raced through options. She had three other grapples, but the port mag was load-bearing for this docking configuration. Without it, the connection wouldn't be secure enough to transfer patients safely.

"Can you bypass the regulator?"

"Working on it. Give me... thirty seconds."

Thirty seconds while maintaining perfect rotational sync with a tumbling ship, in an active debris field, with an unconscious patient and forty minutes of air. Maya kept her hands steady on the controls, making micro-adjustments to hold position.

"Commander, coming alongside now," she said into the comm, her voice betraying nothing. "You might feel some vibration as I match your rotation."

"Twenty seconds," Ari murmured.

A debris fragment pinged off their hull—small, harmless, but a reminder that this field was getting active. Maya adjusted course fractionally, staying in the *Prometheus*'s drift shadow.

"Ten seconds. Almost there."

Maya watched the grapple indicator, willing it to turn green.

"Got it. Bypass is holding. You're good to dock."

"Docking clamps engaging in three... two... one..."

The *clunk* of contact felt like victory. Solid. Secure. The grapple indicator showed green across all four arms.

"We're locked. Pressurizing the connection now. Should have green lights in about ninety seconds."

She let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. Ari's presence in her mind felt warm, reassuring—that particular flavor of relief when a problem gets solved just in time.

"Nice work," Maya said quietly.

"You too. That debris dodge was pretty."

"Thanks. Let's get these people home before anything else decides to get exciting."

The airlock pressurization completed. Maya grabbed the medical kit and cycled through, already shifting into the next phase. Commander Tanaka was exactly where she'd said she'd be, hand on her co-pilot's suited arm, eyes sharp despite the stress.

Professional. Capable. Doing everything right.

"Good job keeping him stable," Maya said, because it was true and because people needed to hear it. "Let's get him onto my ship—I've got better medical equipment and more space to work."

They maneuvered Chen through the airlock. Maya's shoulder protested—she'd wrenched it during that debris dodge—but that was a problem for later. Right now, she had patients.

Once Chen was secured and scanned, Maya allowed herself to relax fractionally. Concussion, moderate, manageable. He'd be fine.

"You did the hard part," she told Commander Tanaka, and meant it.

The flight back was smooth. Maya kept one eye on the grapple regulators—the bypass was holding, but she'd need to file a maintenance report as soon as they docked. The port mag would need a full replacement.

"Commander?" Maya said after a few minutes of silence. "You did good. Really good. A lot of people would have panicked in your situation."

"I've had good training."

"Training gets you through the checklist. What you did—keeping your co-pilot alive, staying calm, giving me clear information—that's character. Ari agrees with me, by the way. And she's usually pretty stingy with compliments."

She felt Ari's amusement in the back of her mind. *I'm really not.*

*Shush. I'm having a moment.*

"Tell Ari thank you," Commander Tanaka said.

"She heard you. She says you're welcome."

Maya guided them back toward the *Calypso*, feeling the familiar satisfaction of a job done right. Close call, but they'd handled it. That's what the training was for.

"Port grapple definitely needs replacing," Ari noted. "And you should probably ice that shoulder."

"Yeah, yeah. Add it to the list."

But she was smiling.

## Vignette Three: Kepler

### Patient Perspective

Dr. Kavita Sharma had dealt with plenty of emergencies in her career as a field medic, but this was a new one.

The research vessel *Kepler* had suffered a cascading systems failure—not catastrophic, but comprehensive. Main power was cycling on and off unpredictably, life support was stable but the backups kept triggering false alarms, and three of her crew were trapped in the aft observation module when the bulkhead door sealed itself and refused to open.

She could see them through the viewport, pounding on the door. Their suit radios were working—she could hear them, calm but urgent, reporting their air supply and requesting assistance. But the door controls were completely unresponsive.

"This is Rescue Engineer Reyes inbound on the *Kepler*. Dr. Sharma, what's your current situation?"

Kavita felt relief wash through her. "Three crew trapped in aft observation module. Bulkhead door sealed due to systems malfunction and won't respond to manual override. They're suited with about ninety minutes of air. The rest of us are secure in the forward sections."

"Copy that. I'm ten minutes out. I'm going to come aboard and we'll get that door open. How's the access to the observation module from your side?"

"Direct corridor from the main airlock, about fifteen meters. The corridor pressure is stable."

"Perfect. Stand by, we're coming in."

The ten minutes felt longer than they should have. Kavita kept her trapped crew updated, kept them talking, kept them calm. They were professionals—astrobiologists, used to working in challenging conditions—but ninety minutes of air was ninety minutes of air.

The docking clamps engaged with that familiar solid *thunk*. Moments later, Maya cycled through the airlock carrying what looked like a portable cutting rig and several other pieces of equipment Kavita didn't immediately recognize.

"Dr. Sharma. Show me the door."

Kavita led her down the corridor at a jog. Through the viewport in the sealed bulkhead, Maya could see three suited figures watching anxiously. She waved, gave them a thumbs up. No point in everyone being stressed.

"Okay, I see what we've got here." Maya set down her equipment and pulled out a diagnostic scanner, running it over the door's control panel. "Your systems failure triggered an emergency containment protocol—the door thinks there's a hull breach on the other side. It's not going to open until we convince it otherwise or we physically override it."

Through the viewport, Kavita could see her crew watching anxiously.

Maya waved at them, gave a casual thumbs up, then turned back to her scanner. "Let's try the polite approach first. Ari, can you interface with their system protocols?"

A pause. Maya's expression didn't change, but something shifted—a subtle tension in her shoulders.

"Okay, we're going with the impolite approach then." Maya pulled out what looked like a mechanical override key. "Dr. Sharma, I need you to hold this light for me while I work. This is going to take about fifteen minutes, maybe twenty. Your crew has plenty of air for that, so no need to panic."

"What happened to the polite approach?"

"Their system's not playing nice with our handshake protocols. Happens sometimes with older ships. We're going manual." Maya was already removing the control panel cover, exposing the mechanical linkage beneath. "I've done this about a hundred times. Tedious, but reliable."

Kavita held the light where directed and watched Maya work. The rescue engineer's hands moved with practiced confidence, testing each mechanical connection, tracing the linkage pathway, occasionally muttering technical observations that Kavita only half understood.

"There we go. Found the stuck actuator." Maya pulled out a small tool that looked like a cross between pliers and a wrench. "This is the fun part. When this releases, the door's going to want to open fast because of the pressure differential. Make sure you're not standing directly in front of it."

"Understood."

"On three. One... two... three."

Maya applied pressure. There was a sharp *click*, followed by a pneumatic hiss, and the bulkhead door slid open with sudden force.

The three trapped crew members practically fell through the opening, relief evident even through their helmets.

"Welcome back," Maya said cheerfully. "Sorry about the wait. Your ship's having a bad day."

Dr. Sharma helped her crew remove their helmets while Maya repacked her equipment with the same methodical efficiency she'd unpacked it with.

"Is everyone else secured?" Maya asked. "Any other systems acting up that could put people at risk?"

"Nothing immediate. Engineering's working on the power cycling issue."

"Good. I'll stay aboard until your systems stabilize, just in case. Ari's already filed a report with fleet maintenance—they'll want to do a full diagnostic on your emergency protocols once you're back at dock."

Kavita realized she'd been holding tension in her shoulders for the past twenty minutes. "Thank you. That could have been much worse."

"That's why they pay me the medium-sized bucks." Maya's expression was easy, relaxed. "The door was never going to stay stuck forever, but forever's a relative term when you're counting down air supply. Glad we could speed things up for you."

* * *

### Maya's Perspective

"Ten minutes out" was accurate this time, and the *Kepler* wasn't tumbling, which made for a pleasant change.

Maya ran through her approach checklist while Ari pulled up the ship's technical specifications. Research vessel, mid-generation, decent maintenance record. The systems failure sounded messy but not dangerous—yet.

"Three crew trapped with ninety minutes of air," Ari said. "That's comfortable. Even if the door's completely jammed, we can cut through in under thirty."

"Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Cutting's loud and stressful for everyone involved." Maya adjusted her approach vector. "Pull up the emergency bulkhead schematics. I want to know what we're dealing with before we dock."

"On it."

The docking sequence was smooth. Maya grabbed her equipment kit—the portable cutting rig just in case, plus the standard override tools and diagnostic scanner—and cycled through the airlock.

Dr. Sharma met her immediately, professional and clearly stressed but holding it together. Good. Maya liked working with people who didn't fall apart.

They jogged down the corridor together. Through the viewport in the sealed bulkhead, Maya could see three suited figures watching anxiously. She waved, gave them a thumbs up. No point in everyone being stressed.

"Okay, I see what we've got here." Maya set down her equipment and pulled out the diagnostic scanner, running it over the door's control panel. The readings made sense—emergency containment protocol, triggered by the systems failure. Textbook case.

"Let's try the polite approach first. Ari, can you interface with their system protocols?"

Silence.

Maya felt the absence like a dropped note in music. Ari was always *there*, a constant presence in the back of her mind. Now there was just... nothing.

Her hands didn't stop moving—muscle memory kept the scanner running over the control panel—but her mind raced. *Stay calm. Don't alarm the patient. Ari's probably just having a handshake issue with their system. She'll be back in a second.*

"Okay, we're going with the impolite approach then." Maya kept her voice level, casual, as she pulled out the mechanical override key. "Dr. Sharma, I need you to hold this light for me while I work. This is going to take about fifteen minutes, maybe twenty. Your crew has plenty of air for that, so no need to panic."

Internally, she was running diagnostics. Her neural link hardware felt fine—no pain, no warning indicators on her HUD. The suit's comm system was functioning normally; she could still hear Dr. Sharma. But Ari was just... gone.

"What happened to the polite approach?"

"Their system's not playing nice with our handshake protocols." *Because I can't access them at all without Ari.* "Happens sometimes with older ships. We're going manual."

Maya removed the control panel cover, exposing the mechanical linkage. This was fine. She knew how to do this without Ari. She'd *trained* to do this without Ari, back before they'd been paired. It was just going to take longer.

Her fingers traced the linkage pathway, testing connections, looking for the failure point. Every few seconds she'd instinctively reach for Ari's presence and find nothing. The silence in her head felt loud.

*Focus. You've got a job to do. Three people are counting on you.*

"There we go. Found the stuck actuator." She pulled out the release tool, keeping her voice steady and confident because Dr. Sharma needed to see competence, not uncertainty. "This is the fun part. When this releases, the door's going to want to open fast because of the pressure differential. Make sure you're not standing directly in front of it."

She applied pressure to the actuator. The mechanism released with a satisfying *click*, and the door slid open exactly as it should.

The trapped crew stumbled through, relief evident on their faces.

"Welcome back," Maya said, because that's what she always said, and maintaining routine helped keep her own nerves steady. "Sorry about the wait. Your ship's having a bad day."

She repacked her equipment methodically, using the familiar task to center herself. Still no Ari. The silence felt wrong, like missing a limb.

"Is everyone else secured?" she asked Dr. Sharma. "Any other systems acting up that could put people at risk?"

"Nothing immediate. Engineering's working on the power cycling issue."

"Good. I'll stay aboard until your systems stabilize, just in case."

*And until I figure out what the hell is going on with my comms.*

Maya moved back toward the airlock, trying to look casual while running every diagnostic she could think of. Her neural link hardware showed green across the board. The rescue craft's systems were all nominal. But Ari was still silent.

She cycled through the airlock and back into her own ship, closing the hatch behind her.

"Ari?" she said aloud, even though she knew the neural link should work regardless. "Ari, if you can hear me, any kind of signal would be great right about now."

Nothing.

Maya sat in the pilot's seat and pulled up the communication logs. Everything looked normal until about twelve minutes ago, right around when she'd docked with the *Kepler*. Then—nothing. Just a clean drop.

Her heart rate was elevated. She noticed it clinically, forced herself to breathe slowly. *This is fine. This is solvable. Systems fail sometimes. That's why you train for redundancy.*

But the silence in her head felt like being alone in a way she hadn't experienced in years.

She ran another diagnostic. Checked the logs again. Started a system reboot sequence on the neural link hardware.

And waited.

The reboot cycle took forty-three seconds. Each one felt longer than it should.

Then—

*"—aya? Maya, can you hear me?"*

The relief was physical. Maya actually slumped in her seat.

"Ari. Yes. I can hear you. What the hell happened?"

*"Interference from the* Kepler*'s systems failure. Their emergency protocols generated some kind of feedback loop that knocked out our neural link handshake. I've been trying to reestablish for the past fifteen minutes. Are you okay?"*

"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Got the door open, everyone's safe." Maya's voice was steadier than she felt. "Just... that was not a fun fifteen minutes on my end."

*"I know. I'm sorry. I could see your vitals but couldn't communicate. Your heart rate spiked when you realized I was gone."*

"I handled it."

*"You did. But you don't have to pretend it wasn't stressful."*

Maya let out a long breath. "Okay. Yeah. That sucked. I don't like not being able to reach you."

*"The feeling's mutual. I've flagged the* Kepler*'s systems for a full review—whatever's causing their cascade failure has some weird interference properties that shouldn't exist. Fleet maintenance needs to look at it."*

"Copy that." Maya ran a hand through her hair, then started the undocking sequence. The mechanical familiarity of it helped. "Let's get back to the *Calypso*. I could use a coffee."

*"And maybe a debrief with medical about that heart rate spike?"*

"Don't push it."

*"I'm just saying, there are protocols—"*

"Ari."

*"Fine. Coffee first. Then we talk about protocols."*

Despite everything, Maya smiled. "Deal."

The silence in her head was gone, replaced by Ari's familiar presence. The world felt right again.

But Maya filed the experience away mentally. Something to think about later, when she wasn't trying to navigate out of a debris field.

*What would happen if the separation wasn't temporary?*

She pushed the thought aside and focused on flying.

* * *

## Vignette Four: Osprey

### Patient Perspective

Lieutenant Marcus Webb had done everything by the book, and it still wasn't enough.

The mining drone tender *Osprey* had taken damage from a rogue piece of equipment—a cargo container that had broken loose from somewhere, tumbling through space at the wrong place and wrong time. The impact had sheered off part of their hull plating and triggered a chain reaction: power failures, life support compromised, and worst of all, the main structural beam running through the ship's midsection was now bent at an angle that made the whole vessel groan ominously with each micro-adjustment of their orbit.

Marcus and his engineer, Petty Officer Kim, had sealed themselves in the forward command module. They were safe for now, but the ship was folding in on itself like a crushed can in slow motion. Every few minutes, another stress alarm would sound as metal yielded somewhere in the structure.

"*Osprey*, this is Rescue Engineer Reyes. I'm reading your structural telemetry and I'm not going to lie to you—your ship is having a really bad day. But we're going to get you out before it gets worse. Status on your crew?"

"Two crew, forward module, both healthy," Marcus reported, trying to keep his voice steady. "But Rescue Engineer, I need to tell you—the structural integrity is failing. We're getting stress warnings every few minutes. I don't know how long before—"

"I see it. Your main longitudinal beam is compromised and the hull's folding. You've probably got about forty minutes before structural collapse, which gives us plenty of time. I'm twelve minutes out."

*Plenty of time.* Marcus looked at Kim, who was monitoring the structural readouts with increasing alarm. Another groan of tortured metal resonated through the hull.

"I'm going to dock at your forward airlock," Maya continued, her voice calm as if she were discussing dinner plans. "But here's the thing—your ship is folding, which means the approach corridor is going to keep getting narrower. I need to come in fast enough that I don't get caught if something shifts, but slow enough that I don't ram you and make things worse. It's going to look a little aggressive from your perspective."

"Understood," Marcus said, though he wasn't sure he did.

"You're going to hear me coming. The engines will sound close—closer than you'd probably like. But I've done this before. Just stay strapped in and trust the process."

Kim met Marcus's eyes. Neither of them said anything.

Seven minutes later, Marcus heard it—the high-pitched whine of thrusters firing at close range, growing louder. Through the forward viewport, he caught glimpses of Maya's rescue craft maneuvering through the twisted corridor of damaged hull plating, moving *fast*.

The ship groaned again. A stress alarm blared. Metal shrieked somewhere aft.

Maya's craft shot past their viewport, impossibly close, then reversed thrust hard enough that Marcus heard the engines through the hull. She was matching their position while moving backward through a corridor that was actively getting smaller.

"Thirty seconds to dock," Maya announced, her voice still unnervingly calm. "Your ship just shifted another eight degrees. Adjusting approach."

Marcus watched through the viewport as Maya's craft pivoted, slid sideways through a gap that looked way too small, and then—

*Clunk.*

The docking clamps engaged. Solid contact.

"We're locked. Pressurizing now. Get ready to move—we're not sticking around."

The airlock cycled faster than Marcus had ever seen it cycle. Maya appeared in the hatchway, already gesturing them forward.

"Come on, gentlemen. Quickly but carefully. Watch your heads."

They scrambled through into Maya's craft. The interior was cramped but organized, and Marcus barely had time to strap into a jumpseat before Maya was back in the pilot's seat and releasing the clamps.

"Hold on. This exit's going to be sporting."

The rescue craft pulled away from the *Osprey* and immediately dove into a tight turn, threading back through the damaged corridor. Marcus caught a glimpse of twisted hull plating sliding past, close enough to touch.

Maya's hands moved across the controls with fluid precision, making constant micro-adjustments. The craft banked, rolled, slipped through a gap that seemed to close behind them—

And then they were clear. Open space. The *Osprey* behind them, still groaning and folding in on itself.

"Everyone okay back there?" Maya asked.

"Yeah," Marcus managed. His hands were shaking. "That was... that was really close."

"Little bit," Maya agreed cheerfully. "But close only counts in horseshoes and nuclear weapons. We're all fine."

Kim let out a breathless laugh. "How many times have you done that?"

"The 'fly through a collapsing ship' thing? Maybe a dozen. The 'make it look easy' thing? Still working on that part." She adjusted their course toward the *Calypso*. "Your ship's going to fully collapse in about fifteen minutes, for what it's worth. Fleet'll recover what's left for the investigation, but you two did everything right. Sometimes equipment just fails in exciting ways."

Marcus watched through the viewport as the *Osprey* continued its slow-motion death. Another section of hull buckled visibly.

They'd been in there five minutes ago.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

"Just doing the job. Ari says your engineering reports were textbook, by the way. Made our approach calculations a lot easier when we knew exactly what we were dealing with."

Marcus noticed Maya hadn't broken a sweat. Her breathing was steady, her hands relaxed on the controls. Like she'd just parallel parked, not threaded a spacecraft through a collapsing corridor at high speed.

"Does it ever get routine?" Kim asked. "Rescues like that?"

Maya was quiet for a moment. "The technical parts do. The 'keeping people alive' part never does. That's what makes it worth doing."

The rest of the flight back was quiet. Marcus kept looking back at where the *Osprey* had been, thinking about how close they'd cut it.

When they docked at the *Calypso*, Maya helped them through the airlock with the same casual competence she'd shown throughout.

"Medical's going to check you over—standard procedure. You'll probably get some time off to decompress. Use it. Don't try to tough it out."

She was already turning away, heading back to her craft, when Marcus called after her.

"Rescue Engineer? That thing you said about horseshoes and nuclear weapons?"

Maya glanced back, eyebrow raised.

"I think we can add collapsing spaceships to that list."

She grinned. "I'll make a note in my manual."

* * *

### Maya's Perspective

Maya studied the structural telemetry from the *Osprey* and didn't like what she saw.

"That's not good," Ari said, which was her way of saying *that's really bad*.

The main longitudinal beam—the spine of the ship—was bent at a fifteen-degree angle and still yielding. The hull plating was folding inward, creating a progressively narrowing corridor between the damaged sections and the forward command module where the crew was trapped.

"How long do we have?" Maya asked, already running approach calculations.

"Forty-two minutes until catastrophic structural failure. Maybe less if another stress point gives way."

"And the approach corridor?"

"Currently 8.3 meters at the widest point, narrowing to 4.1 meters at the damaged section. Our craft is 3.8 meters at the widest with grapples retracted."

"So we've got sixty centimeters of clearance in the best case."

"And it's getting smaller. The fold rate suggests you'll lose approximately twelve centimeters per minute."

Maya did the math. Twelve minutes to get there. Twelve centimeters per minute meant they'd lose about 1.4 meters of clearance by the time she arrived. That would leave them... not much.

"We need to move fast."

"Agreed. But Maya—if the structure shifts while you're in that corridor..."

"I know." She didn't need Ari to finish the sentence. If the ship folded while she was inside, she'd be crushed along with her rescue craft. "Let's make sure that doesn't happen. Can you monitor the stress points in real-time during approach?"

"Yes, but I can't predict when they'll fail."

"Good enough. If you see something about to give, you yell."

Maya opened the comm channel. "*Osprey*, this is Rescue Engineer Reyes. I'm reading your structural telemetry and I'm not going to lie to you—your ship is having a really bad day. But we're going to get you out before it gets worse. Status on your crew?"

Lieutenant Webb's voice was steady but stressed. He gave her the rundown—two crew, forward module, healthy but trapped. Then he mentioned what she'd already seen: the structural integrity was failing.

"I see it. Your main longitudinal beam is compromised and the hull's folding. You've probably got about forty minutes before structural collapse, which gives us plenty of time. I'm twelve minutes out."

She heard the uncertainty in his voice and didn't blame him. Forty minutes sounded like plenty until you did the math on how fast that corridor was closing.

"I'm going to dock at your forward airlock. But here's the thing—your ship is folding, which means the approach corridor is going to keep getting narrower. I need to come in fast enough that I don't get caught if something shifts, but slow enough that I don't ram you and make things worse. It's going to look a little aggressive from your perspective."

*Aggressive* was diplomatic. What she was planning would look insane from inside that command module.

Maya pushed the engines harder than she normally would, shaving two minutes off her approach time. Every second mattered.

"Stress readings are increasing," Ari reported. "The fold rate just accelerated. You're now losing approximately eighteen centimeters per minute."

"Fantastic. New corridor clearance estimate?"

"By the time you arrive... 2.7 meters at the narrowest point."

Maya felt her jaw tighten. 2.7 meters. Her craft was 3.8 meters wide.

"I'll need to go in at an angle. If I bank thirty-two degrees and retract everything, we can thread it."

"Maya, that's less than forty centimeters of clearance on each side."

"I'm aware."

"At the speed you're planning—"

"Ari. Do you have a better plan?"

Silence for two seconds. "No."

"Then we're doing this. Start calculating the optimal entry angle. Factor in their continued fold rate and give me real-time adjustments."

"Calculating now."

Maya brought the rescue craft in hot, decelerating hard as she approached the *Osprey*. Through her viewport, she could see the twisted hull plating, the stressed metal, the way the ship was literally folding in on itself.

The approach corridor looked impossibly narrow.

"Optimal entry angle is thirty-one point four degrees," Ari said. "But Maya, that assumes the structure doesn't shift. If anything gives way while you're inside—"

"Then you'll warn me and I'll adjust. I trust you."

She heard Ari's hesitation, then: "I trust you too. Be careful."

Maya lined up her approach, rolled the craft to the calculated angle, and committed. The engines roared as she shot into the corridor, moving fast—faster than she'd normally dare in such tight quarters.

Twisted hull plating flashed past on both sides. Her clearance was exactly as tight as Ari had calculated. Maybe tighter.

"Stress point sigma-seven is spiking," Ari warned. "Shift predicted in fourteen seconds."

"Which way?"

"Port side, inward. Eight centimeters."

Maya adjusted her angle fractionally, giving herself more clearance on the port side. She was halfway through the corridor now, her engines still firing in reverse to control her speed.

The ship groaned. She heard it through her hull.

"Shift occurring now," Ari said.

Maya saw the hull plating on her port side buckle inward. Not much—maybe ten centimeters—but at these tolerances that was everything. The gap she'd been flying through was now narrower than her craft's width.

Her hands moved on instinct. She rolled another three degrees, pushed her starboard thrusters to slide sideways, threaded through the gap that was closing—

And then she was through. Forward section. The command module airlock was right there.

"Thirty seconds to dock," she announced over the comm, keeping her voice level despite her elevated heart rate. "Your ship just shifted another eight degrees. Adjusting approach."

She pivoted the craft, killed her forward momentum, and brought them in for docking. The clamps engaged with that satisfying *clunk* of solid contact.

"We're locked. Pressurizing now. Get ready to move—we're not sticking around."

Maya was already through the airlock before the pressure equalized fully. Lieutenant Webb and Petty Officer Kim were right there, and she gestured them forward immediately.

No time for pleasantries. That corridor was getting narrower every second, and they needed to exit before it became impossible.

"Come on, gentlemen. Quickly but carefully. Watch your heads."

They scrambled through. Maya sealed the airlock and was back in the pilot's seat in seconds.

"Hold on. This exit's going to be sporting."

She released the docking clamps and immediately dove into her exit maneuver. The corridor was even narrower now than when she'd entered—probably fifteen centimeters tighter on each side.

"Stress point sigma-seven is critical," Ari warned. "Imminent failure."

"How imminent?"

"Six seconds."

Maya pushed the engines harder, rolled to maximize her clearance, and shot through the narrowing gap. Behind them, she heard the metallic shriek of structural failure.

"Port section just collapsed," Ari reported. "If you'd delayed another three seconds—"

"But I didn't." Maya threaded through the last narrow section and they were clear. Open space. The *Osprey* behind them, visibly folding now, sections crumpling.

Her hands were steady on the controls, but she could feel the adrenaline singing through her system. That had been closer than she liked.

"Everyone okay back there?" she asked, because maintaining routine helped ground her.

"Yeah," Lieutenant Webb said. He sounded shaky. "That was... that was really close."

"Little bit," Maya agreed, allowing herself a small smile now that they were safe. Her shoulder ached—she'd tensed during that last maneuver. "But close only counts in horseshoes and nuclear weapons. We're all fine."

She heard Petty Officer Kim laugh breathlessly. "How many times have you done that?"

"The 'fly through a collapsing ship' thing? Maybe a dozen." *Though none quite that tight.* "The 'make it look easy' thing? Still working on that part."

She adjusted their course toward the *Calypso*, letting the familiar routine of navigation settle her nerves.

"That was well executed," Ari said quietly in her mind. "Margins were thin, but your adjustments were precise."

"Thanks. How's my heart rate?"

"Elevated but within acceptable parameters. You'll want to file this one under 'technically successful but don't make it look that close next time.'"

Maya almost laughed. "Yeah. Add that to the list."

She glanced back at Webb and Kim, who were staring out the viewport at their collapsing ship. They looked shaken but safe. That was what mattered.

"Your engineering reports were textbook, by the way," she said, relaying what Ari had noted. "Made our approach calculations a lot easier when we knew exactly what we were dealing with."

"Does it ever get routine?" Kim asked. "Rescues like that?"

Maya considered the question. The technical parts did become routine—the calculations, the procedures, the muscle memory. But the stakes? The knowledge that people's lives depended on her threading gaps measured in centimeters?

"The technical parts do. The 'keeping people alive' part never does. That's what makes it worth doing."

The flight back was quiet. Maya ran post-mission diagnostics, noted some minor hull scoring from how close they'd cut it, and filed a mental note to get her stress tolerance checked. That last maneuver had pushed her craft closer to its limits than was probably wise.

But they'd made it. Everyone was safe.

When they docked at the *Calypso*, Maya helped her passengers through the airlock and sent them toward medical with her standard reassurances.

Lieutenant Webb called after her: "Rescue Engineer? That thing you said about horseshoes and nuclear weapons? I think we can add collapsing spaceships to that list."

Maya grinned despite herself. "I'll make a note in my manual."

She watched them head toward medical, then returned to her craft. Her hands were still completely steady.

It was only when she sat back in the pilot's seat that she allowed herself to acknowledge how close that had really been.

"Ari?"

"Yes?"

"Let's not do that again for a while."

"Agreed. Coffee?"

"Coffee sounds perfect."

## Vignette Five: Rescue Gone Wrong

### Patient Perspective (Takeshi Yamada)

Engineer First Class Takeshi Yamada had been doing fine until he wasn't.

The mining platform worker—a contract specialist named Rodriguez—had been trapped in a collapsed maintenance shaft for forty minutes before Takeshi arrived. Standard extraction: stabilize the patient, secure the debris, create an exit path. Textbook.

Except Rodriguez was hypoxic, probably had been for a while before the distress call went out, and hypoxic people didn't follow the script.

"Sir, I need you to stay still," Takeshi said for the third time, trying to position the oxygen mask while Rodriguez thrashed weakly against him. "You're not getting enough air. This will help."

"Get *off*—can't breathe—you're—" Rodriguez's words slurred together, his movements uncoordinated but surprisingly strong. He knocked the oxygen mask from Takeshi's hand and it clattered against the debris.

"Rodriguez, listen to me—"

The patient's elbow caught Takeshi in the ribs. Not hard, not intentional, just the flailing of someone whose brain wasn't getting enough oxygen to process what was happening. But it knocked Takeshi off balance in the cramped space, and his suit telemetry immediately started screaming warnings.

Takeshi looked down. His suit's left leg seal was compromised—caught on a piece of sharp debris during the fall. Not catastrophic, but not good. He was losing pressure slowly.

"Shit." He triggered his emergency beacon while simultaneously trying to secure Rodriguez, who was still fighting him. "Dispatch, this is Yamada. I have a suit breach, losing pressure slowly. Patient is hypoxic and combative. I need backup."

"Copy that, Yamada. RE Reyes is three minutes out. Can you stabilize until she arrives?"

Three minutes. Takeshi assessed quickly: his suit pressure was dropping but not critical yet. He had maybe ten minutes before it became a problem. Rodriguez had less than that if Takeshi couldn't get oxygen into him.

"Affirmative. Three minutes."

He abandoned trying to reason with Rodriguez and just used mass—pinning the smaller man's arms while fighting to get the oxygen mask back into position. Rodriguez bucked against him, making sounds that were half words and half panic.

"I know, I know this feels wrong to you," Takeshi said, keeping his voice calm even though his own heart was pounding. "Your brain isn't working right. I'm trying to help. Just—*hold still*—"

He finally got the mask over Rodriguez's face and held it there through sheer determination. The oxygen flow started. Rodriguez kept fighting for another ten seconds, then gradually his movements became less frantic. His eyes started to focus.

"There you go," Takeshi said, not relaxing his grip yet. "Oxygen. That's better, right?"

Rodriguez's breathing steadied. His eyes met Takeshi's, and Takeshi saw the confusion there—the slow realization that he'd been fighting the person trying to save him.

"Sorry," Rodriguez managed through the mask. "I didn't—I couldn't—"

"It's okay. Hypoxia does that. You weren't in control." Takeshi glanced at his own suit telemetry. Pressure still dropping. Five minutes, maybe, before he'd need supplemental oxygen himself. "Just keep that mask on for me."

He heard the approach thrusters before he saw anything—that familiar high-pitched whine that meant a rescue craft was close. Maya's voice came through his comm.

"Yamada, I'm inbound. What's your status?"

"Patient is stabilized on oxygen. Hypoxia-induced combativeness resolved. My suit breach is slow but progressing—I've got maybe five minutes of good air left."

"Copy that. I'm coming in. Sit tight."

Thirty seconds later, Maya appeared in the collapsed shaft's entrance, moving with that characteristic efficient speed. She took in the situation instantly—Rodriguez with the oxygen mask, Takeshi's damaged suit, the cramped space.

"Hey there, Rodriguez," she said cheerfully. "I hear you've been giving my colleague here a workout. How're you feeling?"

"Better," Rodriguez said weakly. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to—"

"Nobody ever means to. Hypoxia's a bastard like that. Makes you fight the people trying to help you. You're doing great now." She was already pulling out a medical scanner, running it over Rodriguez while simultaneously assessing the debris situation. "Takeshi, you good to assist or do you need to get out of here?"

Takeshi checked his suit pressure again. "I can assist for a few more minutes."

"Perfect. Here's what we're doing: I'm going to stabilize Rodriguez for transport while you prep the exit path. I've got a stretcher outside that we'll use to get him out. Your suit breach—how bad?"

"Left leg seal. Losing pressure at about 0.3 PSI per minute."

"Okay. You've got four, maybe five minutes before that becomes a you-problem instead of just an inconvenience. Let's move fast." She locked eyes with him. "You did good work here. Keeping him alive while hypoxic and combative is not easy."

The acknowledgment settled something in Takeshi's chest. He nodded and moved to start clearing the exit path while Maya worked on Rodriguez.

They moved like a well-choreographed team—Takeshi clearing debris, Maya stabilizing the patient, both of them working efficiently in the cramped space. Rodriguez stayed calm now, his oxygen-deprived brain slowly recovering.

"Stretcher's ready," Maya announced. "Takeshi, help me get him secured, then you're getting out of here ahead of us. I don't want your suit failing while you're waiting for us to finish."

"I can—"

"That wasn't a request. You did your job. Now let me do mine."

They got Rodriguez onto the stretcher. Takeshi helped guide it toward the exit, then Maya physically pushed him ahead.

"Go. Get to the airlock. I've got him."

Takeshi went, his suit pressure now reading 10.2 PSI and dropping. He made it to the airlock and cycled through, feeling his ears pop as the pressure equalized. His suit finally stopped its warning alarms.

Five minutes later, Maya emerged with Rodriguez on the stretcher, moving smoothly despite the awkward load.

"Everyone accounted for," she said over the comm. "Yamada, get yourself to medical. That suit breach probably gave you some minor hypoxia yourself. Rodriguez, you're getting the full workup. And next time someone tries to give you oxygen, maybe don't punch them."

"I didn't punch him," Rodriguez protested weakly.

"Close enough." But her tone was gentle.

Takeshi sat in the airlock, feeling the adrenaline drain away. His ribs hurt where Rodriguez had elbowed him. His hands were shaking slightly.

Maya appeared in front of him, having handed Rodriguez off to the medical team.

"You okay?" she asked.

"Yeah. Just... that got complicated fast."

"It happens. Hypoxic patients are unpredictable. You kept him alive and kept yourself alive. That's a win in my book." She studied him for a moment. "Take the rest of the shift off. Process it, get checked out, don't try to tough it out. That's an order from someone who's been there."

"Thanks, Maya."

"Anytime. Ari says your approach was solid, by the way. You just got unlucky with a combative patient and sharp debris. Sometimes the universe stacks things against you." She grinned. "But hey, now you've got a story about the time you wrestled a hypoxic miner while your suit was failing. That's worth at least two rounds at the crew lounge."

Despite everything, Takeshi laughed.

## Vignette Six: Role Reversal

### Maya as Patient

The problem wasn't the rescue itself. The rescue was going fine.

Commander Park and his co-pilot were trapped in their scout ship after a collision with debris had disabled their engines and cracked their cockpit seal. Standard extraction: Maya had docked smoothly, was halfway through transferring them to her craft when she heard Ari's warning.

"Maya, proximity alert. Debris incoming, vector—"

Maya saw it through the viewport—a chunk of hull plating, maybe two meters across, tumbling fast. Too fast. Too close.

"Get inside!" she shouted to Commander Park, shoving him toward her airlock.

She tried to follow, but the debris hit the docking collar before she could clear it.

The impact wasn't catastrophic. No explosion, no immediate decompression. Just a sharp, violent jolt that sent Maya sprawling across the narrow space between the two ships. Her helmet cracked against something hard—a structural beam, maybe—and her HUD flickered, died, came back with half its systems showing red.

"Maya?" Ari's voice, sharp with concern.

"I'm okay. I'm—" Maya tried to push herself up and her left arm didn't respond properly. She looked down. Her suit sleeve was torn, the material scorched. Pressure seal compromised. "Ari, I've got a suit breach. Left arm."

"I see it. You need to get back to the craft now. Your pressure is dropping."

Maya tried to stand. Her head swam. The helmet impact had been harder than she'd realized. "Commander Park?"

"I'm here!" Park's voice came through the comm. "I'm in your airlock. Are you—oh God, your suit—"

"I'm coming." Maya pushed herself toward her craft, but her movements felt uncoordinated. The suit breach was worse than she'd thought—she could feel the cold now, the pressure drop making her ears pop. Her HUD was scrolling warnings she couldn't quite focus on.

She made it three steps before her vision grayed at the edges.

"Maya, your oxygen saturation is dropping," Ari said, and there was something in her voice Maya had never heard before. Fear. "You need to move faster."

"Trying," Maya managed. Her words sounded slurred even to her own ears. The corridor between the ships seemed longer than it had been a minute ago. Why was it so long?

She stumbled. Caught herself on the docking collar. Her fingers felt numb.

"Commander Park, can you reach her?" That was a different voice. Someone else on the comm. When had that happened?

"I'm trying—Maya, grab my hand!"

Maya saw the hand reaching for her. She tried to lift her arm but couldn't remember which one was supposed to work. Both of them felt heavy. Everything felt heavy.

"Maya." Ari's voice cut through the fog. "Listen to me. You're hypoxic. Your brain isn't working right. You need to grab Commander Park's hand. Can you see his hand?"

Maya blinked. Focused. Yes. Hand. She should grab it.

She reached out—with her good arm, she thought, though she wasn't sure anymore—and felt fingers close around her wrist.

"Got her!" Park said. "I'm pulling her in."

Maya felt herself being dragged. The movement made her head swim worse. She tried to help, tried to coordinate her legs, but they weren't responding properly.

Then she was inside. The airlock. Park was sealing the hatch.

"Ari, I've got her," Park said, breathing hard. "But her suit breach is bad. I don't know how to—"

"Emergency seal kit, left side storage." Ari's voice was controlled now, all business. "Gray container with red markings. You need to patch her suit before I can pressurize this airlock."

Maya wanted to help, wanted to tell Park where the kit was, but her mouth wasn't forming words properly anymore. She could hear herself making sounds, but they didn't mean anything.

Park's face appeared above her, pale and frightened. His hands were moving, doing something to her arm. It should hurt but didn't. That seemed wrong somehow.

"I think I've got it sealed," Park said. "Ari, is this right?"

"That's good. Stand clear. Pressurizing now."

Maya felt the air rushing in. Her ears popped again. The gray at the edges of her vision started to recede, slowly, like fog lifting.

"Oxygen mask," Ari instructed. "Same storage compartment, blue kit. Put it over her face."

Maya felt the mask settle over her nose and mouth. Oxygen flooded in, clean and cold and perfect. She took a breath. Then another. The fog continued to lift.

"There you go," Park said, his voice shaking. "That's better, right? Just breathe."

Maya's brain started working again, slowly. She was lying on the floor of her own airlock. Commander Park was crouched beside her, looking terrified. Her left arm throbbed—the suit seal was patched but not comfortable.

"Ari?" she managed.

"I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."

"I was scared," Maya admitted quietly.

"I know. So was I."

The medical bay doors opened and Maya let them take her inside, still breathing oxygen, still feeling the echo of that gray fog at the edges of her vision.

She'd spent years pulling people out of situations exactly like this. She'd never quite understood the terror until now.

That felt like something she needed to think about.

Later. After her head stopped pounding.

* * *

### Aftermath

They kept Maya in medical for six hours.

Standard protocol for hypoxia with loss of consciousness—monitoring, scans, observation. Maya knew the checklist by heart. She'd recommended it to dozens of patients herself, always with the same reassurance: "It's just precautionary, but it's important."

Now she was the one lying in the med bay bed, staring at the ceiling, feeling the weight of "just precautionary" from the other side.

Ari had been quiet for most of it. Present, but not pushing conversation. Maya appreciated that more than she could say.

"Your scans look good," the medical officer said, reviewing the results. "No signs of lasting damage. You'll have a hell of a headache for a day or two, and that arm's going to be sore, but you're clear to go. Forty-eight hours mandatory rest, then light duty for another seventy-two."

* * *

## Vignette Seven: Hypoxia Training

When the oxygen level came back up, the room was quiet, the recruits all staring at their tasks.

Maya entered quietly, stopping in front of Torres' station. She recognized his expression when he looked up. She decided to ask anyway, "Torres, top of your class, tell me honestly: Do you see value in this exercise?"

Without hesitation, Torres answered quietly, "Yes, ma'am."

Maya looked up. "I made this exercise a requirement because I found myself in an airlock, unable to grab the hand reaching to pull me to safety."

A recruit in the back raised his hand. "How did you make it?"

Maya turned to look at Ari, still in the observation room. Finally, she said, "I got lucky." She took a breath, ready to explain more, but caught Ari's slight head shake.

Maya turned back to the recruits to see they were already processing the experience, some of them with the slightly glazed look of inexperienced conversation with their ARIA. She quietly walked to the door.

"Dismissed."

* * *

## Vignette Eight: Return to Normal

### The Meridian

"So this is weird, right?" Maya said, floating through the empty corridor of the cargo hauler *Meridian*. "I'm not just being paranoid?"

"It's definitely weird," Ari confirmed. "No distress call, no crew, no signs of struggle or emergency. Just... nothing."

Maya had been cleared for light duty three days ago, and this was supposed to be her return-to-normal mission. A routine check on a ship that had stopped responding to hails—probably a communications malfunction, maybe some minor systems failure. Easy. Low-stress. The kind of thing you gave someone who was still technically recovering from a hypoxia incident.

Except the *Meridian* was completely abandoned.

"Life support is running," Maya noted, checking her scanner. "Gravity's off but everything else looks nominal. No hull breaches, no fire damage, no signs of decompression."

"And yet no crew." Ari's presence in her mind felt particularly solid today—Maya had noticed she was being more... present since the incident. Not intrusive, just there. Like Ari was making sure Maya knew she wasn't alone.

Maya appreciated it more than she'd say out loud.

She pushed off down the corridor toward the bridge, moving carefully despite the zero-G being perfectly safe.

The bridge was empty. Consoles were powered down properly. Personal effects were still secured in lockers.

"Pulling up the ship's logs," Ari said. "Last entry is from six days ago. Routine systems check, all normal. Then... nothing."

"No distress call? No captain's log about an emergency?"

"Nothing. The logs just stop."

Maya floated to the captain's chair and pulled up the navigation history. "They were on a standard cargo route. Nothing unusual in their trajectory. No deviation from planned course."

"Except they're not where they're supposed to be anymore."

That was true. The *Meridian* had drifted significantly from its filed flight plan, which is what had triggered the wellness check in the first place.

"Emergency pods?" Maya asked.

"Checking now." A pause. "All present. Both escape shuttles are still in their berths."

"So they didn't evacuate."

"Doesn't look like it."

Maya worked her way through the rest of the ship systematically. Crew quarters—bunks unmade, personal items left behind. Galley—half-eaten meal on one of the tables, now dried and unappetizing. Engine room—everything running on automated systems, well within normal parameters.

"This is giving me the creeps," Maya admitted.

"Your heart rate is slightly elevated," Ari observed. "Not concerning, but I'm monitoring."

"Thanks. I appreciate the vote of confidence."

"Just doing my job."

Maya found herself smiling despite the strangeness of the situation. That was Ari—always watching, always present, but never smothering.

The cargo bay was next. Standard shipping containers, properly secured. Maya scanned them out of habit—nothing unusual, just the industrial supplies the manifest claimed.

"Wait," Ari said. "I'm picking up something in the environmental logs. About fourteen minutes before the ship's logs went silent, there was a brief fluctuation in the internal atmosphere. Not dangerous—just a slight variation in oxygen levels."

"Cause?"

"Unknown. The sensors registered the fluctuation, then everything returned to normal. No explanation recorded."

Maya floated through the cargo bay, looking for anything out of place. "Could someone have vented atmosphere deliberately?"

"Possible but unlikely. The fluctuation was minor and localized to the crew quarters section. If someone wanted to harm the crew, there are more effective methods."

"So what happened to them?"

Ari was quiet for a moment. "I don't know. But Maya—I think we should consider the possibility that they left voluntarily."

"Left? How? You said the escape pods and shuttles are all accounted for."

"They are. But there's a window of about three hours between the last log entry and when the ship's navigation drift became significant enough to trigger the automated alert. That's long enough for another vessel to dock, transfer the crew, and depart without leaving obvious traces."

Maya processed that. "So someone picked them up?"

"It's a theory. The alternative is that something happened to them that left no physical evidence, which seems less likely."

Maya continued her sweep of the ship, but found nothing that contradicted Ari's hypothesis. No bodies, no blood, no signs of violence. Just an empty ship running on autopilot.

"I'm going to check the external cameras," Maya said, pushing toward the bridge again. "Maybe they caught something."

The camera logs were mostly empty—space, stars, the occasional passing debris. But then—

"There," Ari said. "Fourteen minutes before the internal fluctuation. External camera three caught this."

The image was grainy, taken at extreme range, but it showed another ship approaching the *Meridian*. Not a Protectorate vessel—the silhouette was wrong.

"Can you identify it?"

"Running it now. No match in the database. Either it's unregistered or it's using modified hull configurations to avoid identification."

Maya stared at the image. "So an unidentified ship approaches. Something happens with the atmosphere. The crew disappears. The mystery ship leaves."

"That's what the evidence suggests."

"And... both are still here. Locked and sealed."

"So they didn't evacuate in an emergency. They left some other way."

Maya floated to the cargo bay airlock and examined the controls. "This was opened manually. Someone standing right here, entering the code. Not a malfunction."

"Deliberate departure," Ari said. "But why? And where did they go?"

Maya accessed the external sensors—the ones that had come back online after that fourteen-minute gap. "Pulling up the trajectory data from when the cameras came back. If they left in a smaller craft, we should see... there."

The data showed a small heat signature, consistent with a shuttle or lifeboat, moving away from the *Meridian* on a vector that would take it toward... nothing. Empty space. No stations, no other ships in range.

"That doesn't make sense," Maya said. "Unless..."

"Unless they were meeting someone," Ari finished. "Someone who didn't want to show up on official logs."

Maya felt pieces clicking together. "The environmental systems 'fluctuation.' Maybe that was cover. An excuse to return to dock early. But instead of heading back, they rendezvous with someone out here, transfer the crew—"

"And leave the ship running on automated systems to make it look like everything's normal until someone notices the crew's missing." Ari paused. "That's either a very careful evacuation or something less official."

"Smuggling? Desertion?" Maya looked around the empty cargo bay. "Or rescue by someone who didn't want to file the paperwork."

"Should we report this to fleet command?"

Maya considered. Her job was rescue, not investigation. But an abandoned ship with its crew mysteriously vanished wasn't exactly standard operating procedure.

"Yeah. We need to report it. This is... above my pay grade." She pushed off toward the bridge again. "I'll document everything, download the logs, and let the professionals figure out what happened. Our job is to make sure there's nobody here who needs help."

She did one more sweep of the ship—crew quarters, engineering, medical bay. All empty. All showing signs of normal operation until everyone just... left.

"No one here needs rescuing," Maya said finally. "Whatever happened, it was planned. They took the time to secure systems, shut down non-essential equipment properly, even locked the emergency pods so they wouldn't drift."

"Thoughtful of them," Ari said dryly.

Maya made her way back to her own craft and started compiling her report. Abandoned ship, crew missing, evidence of deliberate departure, no signs of distress or danger. Recommend fleet investigation.

As she undocked and set course back to the *Calypso*, she felt an odd sense of anticlimax.

"So much for my easy return-to-normal mission," she said.

"At least nobody was dying," Ari pointed out. "That's a nice change."

"True. Though I'm not sure 'mysteriously abandoned ship' counts as low-stress."

"You handled it fine. No panic, no hesitation, thorough investigation. I'd say you're ready for regular duty."

Maya smiled slightly. "Thanks, Ari."

"Just doing my job."

They flew in comfortable silence for a while. Maya let her mind wander, processing the mystery ship and the vanished crew and all the questions she couldn't answer.

Tomorrow there would probably be a real rescue. Someone with a real emergency who needed her to be at her best.

That was fine. Tomorrow someone probably would.

And she'd be ready.
