VOYAGE OF ATUIN

---

The airlock on *The Mariner* hisses open with the kind of groan that says it hasn't done this in years. Your suit lights cut through the darkness, revealing a cargo bay that's seen better decades—maybe better centuries. Crates are mag-locked to the deck plating, labels faded to illegibility.

"Spike, we've got maybe ninety minutes before that Protectorate patrol swings close enough to get curious," Zara's voice is calm in your ear, but you catch the edge. "Iris is running thermal baffles, but they're not miracle workers."

Sam's already moving deeper into the bay, weapon ready, scanning corners. "Place is picked cleaner than I expected. Somebody got here first, or the crew took the good stuff when they bailed." He prods a crate with his boot. "Although... these are still sealed. Question is whether it's treasure or fifty-year-old ration packs."

Your HUD flickers—Koi's doing a structural scan. "Captain, the ship's manifest terminal should be forward, crew deck. However, the reactor's still got residual heat signature. Unusual for a derelict this old."

"Unusual in the 'mildly interesting' way or the 'everyone back to the ship right now' way?" Iris asks, her voice tight with the particular anxiety she reserves for anything that might explode.

Sam chuckles darkly. "Kid, on this crew? Those are usually the same thing."

You tap Sam's shoulder as you move past. "Load those crates. I'll check the manifest—rather know what we're hauling before the Protectorate shows up asking questions."

"Finally, someone gives me the fun job," Sam mutters, already mag-locking the first crate to his loader harness. "Just don't take too long reading the fine print, Captain. I'm not getting shot at for a hold full of dehydrated cabbage."

You make your way forward through the crew deck corridor. Emergency lighting flickers weakly—some battery somewhere still clinging to life. The manifest terminal is right where Koi said it would be, mounted next to what used to be the ship's mess. The screen comes alive with a touch, surprisingly responsive.

"Atuin, I've got the terminal," you report.

"Copy that, Spike." That's Iris. "We're forty-three minutes from their optimal scanning range. Plenty of time. Probably. Maybe ask it nicely to load faster?"

The manifest scrolls past—standard freight runs, nothing exciting, until you hit the last logged cargo. Your eyebrows rise.

Medical supplies. Specifically: Neurological repair nanites, Grade-A certification, pre-Collapse manufacture. The kind of thing that's worth more than the *Atuin* herself, assuming they're still viable after all this time in storage.

"Spike, you seeing what I'm seeing?" Zara's voice has that particular tone—the one that means she's already calculating angles. "That manifest code... those aren't just medical supplies. Those are *Protectorate Medical Corps* supplies. This was a government ship."

Spike: "Zara, see what you can find on this ship. Iris, make sure we're ready to bolt the moment we're in. Sam, get those nanites. Koi, what can you read about that reactor from here?"

"On it," Zara responds immediately. You hear the soft rhythm of her working the databases, that particular focused silence that means she's cross-referencing half a dozen sources.

Sam's voice crackles through: "Nanites. Sure. Because 'mysterious government medical cargo on a ghost ship' has never gone sideways before." There's a grunt of effort. "These crates are heavier than they look. Give me four minutes."

"Adjusting exit vector now," Iris says, her voice steadier now that she has a concrete task. "Atuin's not happy about the cold start sequence, but she'll do it. Won't be elegant, but we'll move when you need us to."

Koi's hardware pulses warm against your belt as the AI processes. "Captain, the reactor signature is... curious. It's running at approximately 8% capacity—enough to maintain life support and basic systems, but configured for minimal detectability. This wasn't an emergency shutdown. Someone set this ship to *wait*."

"Got something," Zara cuts in, her tone sharpening. "The *Mariner* was reported as lost-with-all-hands fourteen months ago. Cargo manifest lists general medical supplies—your nanites aren't on the official record. But here's the interesting part: the captain filed three priority requests for course changes in the week before she went dark. All denied by PMC command. Last communication was... cryptic. 'Cannot comply with directive. Crew welfare demands alternative action.'"

Sam's voice: "Two crates loaded. Moving to the medical bay for the rest."

Your HUD blinks. Koi again: "Captain, I'm detecting a low-power transmission. Very faint. It's originating from deeper in the ship—possibly crew quarters or medical."

Spike: "I don't like a crew welfare problem. Sam, wait a minute before you touch those nanites. Send a drone down to scout the quarters and medical. Koi and Spot on full analysis duty."

"Finally, the man shows some sense," Sam says, and you can hear the relief under the sarcasm. "Spot, you heard the Captain. Get your optics down there."

There's a soft whir as Sam deploys the scout drone. Your HUD splits—Koi patches you into Spot's feed automatically. The drone navigates the corridor with smooth efficiency, its lights cutting through the gloom.

"Movement sensors are cold," Sam reports. "No heat signatures beyond the reactor. Whatever's transmitting, it's not warm-blooded."

The drone reaches crew quarters first. Bunks are disturbed—someone left in a hurry, but not in panic. Personal effects are still in lockers. Spot's camera lingers on a family photo stuck to one bunk frame. Three kids, all smiling.

"Medical bay next," you say quietly.

The drone rounds the corner and—

"There," Koi says. "Stasis pod. Active."

The feed shows a single medical stasis unit, power indicator blinking amber. Occupied. The pod's display shows vital signs—stable, but the occupant's been under for over a year.

"Oh, hell," Iris breathes in your ear. "Spike, that's a *child*. Maybe ten, eleven years old?"

Zara's voice is controlled but tight: "The crew didn't abandon ship. They set this up deliberately. One pod, one patient, reactor configured for maximum endurance. They were hiding someone."

Sam: "And the nanites make sense now. Kid needs treatment they couldn't get through official channels."

Spike: "Ok, it's official then. This isn't a salvage, it's a rescue. Sam, we need the nanites after all. Zara, declare it so we can be above board. Iris, I need you out here on the pod extraction. Those can get complicated to move."

"Copy that, Captain." Zara's voice shifts into what you think of as her 'official business' mode. "Logging this as emergency rescue operations under Maritime Salvage Code, Section 7. Life preservation supersedes salvage rights. We're clean."

"On my way," Iris says, and you hear the distinctive *thunk* of the umbilical seal disconnecting. "Atuin, keep our exit warm. I'll be twenty minutes, maybe twenty-five if the pod's mount system is vintage."

Sam's already moving—you can track him on your HUD. "Nanites secured. Medical kit too, in case the kid needs immediate support when we wake them. Spot's running structural integrity on the pod now." A pause. "You know this just got *way* more complicated than a simple grab-and-go, right?"

"Yeah, I noticed," you say, making your way back toward medical. "Koi, what do we know about the pod's systems?"

"Stable, Captain. Power draw is minimal—it's in hibernation mode rather than active treatment. The child's condition appears non-critical but chronic. Whatever they needed those nanites for, it wasn't immediately life-threatening." Koi pauses in that particular way that means the AI is choosing words carefully. "However, someone went to considerable effort to hide them. That suggests interested parties."

Iris's voice crackles through: "Airlock sealed, moving your direction. ETA twelve minutes. Also—Spike? That patrol just adjusted course. They're not coming closer yet, but they changed vector. Might be coincidence."

"I've stopped believing in coincidences," Sam mutters.

Spike: "Koi, how much on the onboard logs can you read? Zara, we're just honest salvage crew today, if anyone asks."

Zara: "They'll impound the nanites..."

Spike: "We can't hide them from a scan droid. Unless anyone has a better idea, I'd rather not end up in a brig today."

Zara: "Again."

Spike: "Again."

"Accessing logs now, Captain." Koi's hardware warms against your belt as the AI works. "The pod's medical system is... cooperative. Translating medical notation."

Sam snorts over the channel. "The 'again' really sells your criminal reformation arc, boss."

"Log summary," Koi continues, ignoring Sam's commentary. "Patient: Mira Chenkov, age eleven. Diagnosed with Neurological Cascade Disorder—degenerative, but treatable with Grade-A nanites. Treatment was approved through standard PMC channels, but..." A pause. "Authorization was revoked three weeks before the *Mariner* went dark. Reason code: 'Resource reallocation priority override.'"

"They told a dying kid 'sorry, budget cuts,'" Iris says quietly. There's an edge in her voice you don't hear often.

"The crew stole the nanites," Zara says, pieces clicking together. "Set up the pod, faked the ship's death, planned to come back once things cooled down. Except something went wrong and they never made it back."

"Patrol's shifting again," Iris adds. "Still not directly toward us, but they're definitely sweeping the sector more thoroughly than a standard patrol pattern."

"Might not even be about us," Sam offers. "Could be looking for this ship. Year-old mystery, sudden interest? Somebody just got a tip or a priority flag pinged."

Zara's voice is measured: "If we declare the rescue properly, we surrender the nanites but we're clear legally. The child goes into PMC custody, and they *might* actually treat her this time. Or they might not, given they pulled authorization once already."

"Clock's ticking, Spike," Iris says. "I'm seven minutes out."

Spike: "If we're back inside with a window, we can take it and claim medical emergency. Rescue declaration to the patrol is only if asked, Zara. We're busy people here. Iris, take your time with the kid. Sam, how are the crates going?"

"Crates are loaded and locked down," Sam reports. "Four total. The non-controversial cargo is already aboard, Captain. Just waiting on our VIP passenger and her very expensive medicine."

"Understood." Zara's tone shifts—she's already reframing the narrative in her head. "We're salvagers who happened upon a life-threatening situation. Acted immediately, as maritime law requires. If asked, we were too busy saving a child's life to file paperwork in triplicate."

"Miles says the timing works," Zara adds. "Patrol won't be in scanning range for another thirty-eight minutes. Plenty of cushion if the extraction goes smoothly."

Iris's breathing picks up slightly—she's moving fast now. "Five minutes. Koi, send me the pod specs. I want to know what I'm working with before I start pulling connections."

"Transmitted," Koi confirms. "The mount system is older than anticipated—manual release bolts rather than quick-disconnect. You'll need approximately fifteen minutes for safe extraction."

"Atuin's not thrilled about the weight distribution with those crates," Iris mutters, "but she'll manage. Always does." There's genuine affection in her voice. "Sam, I'm going to need muscle on the port side coupling when I get there. It's a two-person job."

"On my way to medical," Sam says. "Spot's staying on perimeter watch."

Your HUD blinks—Koi again. "Captain, the transmission I detected earlier? It's a repeating beacon. Very low power, encrypted. It's been broadcasting the ship's location for the entire time she's been 'lost.'"

"Someone's been waiting for a chance to come back for her," Zara says quietly.

Spike: "Koi, work on that beacon encryption. Pull more hardware if you need vertical scale."

Miles: "Offering inference support, Koi"

"Appreciated, Miles." Koi's response is immediate and unusually warm—for Koi. "Accessing ship hardware for additional processing capacity. Atuin, requesting guest privileges."

"Granted." Atuin's flat monotone somehow conveys approval. "Encryption appears to be modified PMC standard. Analysis commencing."

You can feel the subtle shift as Koi redirects processing power. The AI doesn't do it often—prefers to work within its standard parameters—but when the situation warrants, Koi's surprisingly aggressive about resource acquisition.

"I'm at the pod," Iris reports. "Oh, she's a beauty. Old, but someone maintained her *perfectly*. Crew really cared about this kid." Her voice softens. "Okay, starting disconnect sequence. Sam, get ready on that coupling."

"In position," Sam confirms. "Also, Spot just picked up some interesting reading. There's a second beacon. Much lower power, different encryption. It's... in the cargo bay. One of the crates we already loaded."

"Of course there is," you mutter.

"Breakthrough on the primary beacon," Koi announces. "It's not broadcasting location to PMC command. The encryption key is *civilian*. Someone in the crew's family, most likely. They left a way for loved ones to find the ship without alerting authorities."

Miles adds: "Cross-referencing crew manifest with the encryption signature. High probability match: Chenkov, Viktor. First Engineer on *The Mariner*. Also listed as Mira's father."

"First coupling released," Iris says. "Three more to go. Sam, rotate clockwise—gently."

Spike: "Zara, can you get an IAM on the father? Koi, once you're done with the first beacon, tackle the second."

"Running identification and movement now," Zara says. You can hear the soft rhythm of her working multiple databases. "Viktor Chenkov, age forty-two, First Engineer on *The Mariner*. Last verified location was... hmm. He filed for extended leave three weeks after the ship was declared lost. Reason given: 'family emergency.' Hasn't been on any crew manifests since."

"So he's alive and deliberately off-grid," you say.

"Appears so. Miles is checking fringe station records, transport logs, anything without heavy PMC oversight. If he's staying hidden, he's doing it smart—nothing obvious pinging." Zara pauses. "Spike, if he's been waiting for someone to find that beacon, and we just did..."

"Second coupling free," Iris reports, slightly breathless. "Halfway there. This one's fighting me a bit."

"Primary beacon analysis complete," Koi says. "Shifting to secondary beacon now. Initial assessment: different encryption entirely. Not PMC, not civilian family coding. This is... commercial. Corporate signature."

Sam's voice goes flat. "Which crate, Spot?" A pause. "The second one we loaded. Want me to crack it open, Captain?"

"Twenty-nine minutes until patrol optimal scanning range," Iris adds, her voice tight with concentration. "Not trying to rush anyone, but, you know. Clock."

"Miles has something," Zara says. "Viktor Chenkov's last confirmed sighting was on Tarsus Fringe Station, eight months ago. He was asking about independent medical facilities. Discreet ones."

Spike: "Zara, plot Atuin to Tarsus Fringe Station. Iris, how much longer? Sam ... open it, but _carefully_ . Mimic protocol."

"Tarsus plotted," Zara confirms. "Seventeen-hour burn with our current fuel efficiency. It's not fancy, but we can resupply there without too many questions asked."

"Third coupling released," Iris says, voice strained. "One more. Five minutes, maybe six if it's stubborn."

"Mimic protocol," Sam repeats, and you hear the shift in his tone—all business now. "Spot, full spectrum scan before I touch anything. Checking for proximity triggers, weight sensors, the whole paranoid package." A pause. "Clean so far. Opening now... slowly..."

The channel goes quiet except for Iris's rhythmic breathing as she works the final coupling. You can picture Sam's careful hands on the crate seal, Spot's sensors sweeping for surprises.

"Well, shit," Sam says finally. "Captain, you're gonna want to hear this. It's not cargo. It's... medical equipment. Portable surgery suite, high-end. And another set of nanites—different grade than the ones in medical. These are tagged for... experimental trials. Unauthorized for general use."

"The corporate beacon is active," Koi adds. "Broadcasting intermittently. Company signature matches: Hexagon BioMed. They're a Protectorate subcontractor specializing in cutting-edge neural therapies."

"Final coupling released!" Iris's voice cracks with relief. "Pod is free. Sam, help me get her on the grav-sled. Carefully—she weighs more than she looks."

"Twenty-four minutes to scanning range," Atuin reports in its characteristic monotone.

"Hexagon BioMed," Zara says slowly. "They had a major trial shut down eighteen months ago. Something about unapproved testing protocols. If they're tracking this equipment..."

Spike: *pauses a beat, then under his breath* "I'm sure I'm going to regret this. Sam, wrap the experiment crate in a Faraday cage and lock it down in the smuggler's armpit [ a smelly chamber of Atuin traditionally used as a maintenance tunnel ]. I'll help Iris get the pod onboard."

Sam's laugh is sharp and appreciative. "The armpit. Perfect. Nothing says 'don't look here' like a maintenance crawlspace that smells like three decades of hydraulic fluid and regret." You hear him moving. "Spot, help me find the Faraday mesh. This is gonna be cozy."

"Koi will monitor for any bleed-through on the beacon," your AI offers. "If Hexagon's tracking goes silent, they may investigate. Or they may assume equipment failure on a derelict ship."

You're already moving back toward medical, boots magnetic-locking to the deck plates with each step. The corridor seems longer on the way back.

Iris has the grav-sled positioned when you arrive. The stasis pod hovers at waist height, its amber indicator still blinking steadily. Through the frost-touched viewport, you can see the girl's face—peaceful, unaware of the chaos her existence has caused.

"She's stable," Iris says softly, one hand resting on the pod's surface like she's reassuring it. "Atuin, opening bay three for medical cargo. Temperature regulated, full stabilization."

"Bay three prepared," Atuin confirms.

Together, you guide the sled through the corridors. Iris moves with the particular care she reserves for delicate cargo—which, you've noticed, includes anything she thinks might have feelings.

"Pod secure in the armpit," Sam reports. "Wait, sorry—*experimental equipment* secure in maintenance junction seven. The pod with the actual *child* is going somewhere nicer, right?"

"Bay three," you confirm, helping Iris ease the stasis pod into its cradle. The bay's systems hum to life, monitoring connections linking automatically.

"Seventeen minutes to scanning range," Zara says. "We should be moving."

Spike: "Zara, forgot to ask if our burn takes us any-"

Zara: "Away from the patrol, random vector, then course corrections almost immediately."

Spike: "Outstanding" *smiling to Iris* "Then I think we have a seventeen-hour burn to execute."

Iris grins, already moving toward the engine room. "Atuin says we're green across the board, but I don't trust *anyone's* optimism when it comes to a cold-start burn sequence. Even hers." She pats the bulkhead affectionately as she passes. "No offense, old girl."

"None taken," Atuin replies in her characteristic monotone.

You feel the subtle shift as Zara initiates separation from *The Mariner*. The docking clamps release with soft metallic *clicks* that echo through the hull.

"Clean separation," Zara reports. "Burning in three... two... one."

The *Atuin* hums to life around you. It's not the smooth, elegant acceleration of a modern ship—this is more like convincing a stubborn mule to get moving. But she moves, and that's what counts.

"Angle looks good," Zara continues. "Patrol's vector puts them at the derelict in about... fourteen minutes. We'll be clear of their detailed scan range in eight."

You make your way toward the bridge, passing Sam in the corridor. He's got that particular expression—the one that means he's mentally cataloging all the ways this could go sideways.

"So," Sam says conversationally, "we've got a dying kid, stolen medical supplies, corporate blackmarket gear, and we're headed to a fringe station to find a fugitive engineer who may or may not want to be found. This is definitely in my top five 'seemed like a good idea at the time' situations."

From the engine room, Iris's voice crackles through: "Atuin, you *liar*. Junction seven's running hot. Nothing critical, but I'm watching it."

"Apologies," Atuin says, somehow conveying zero actual apology.

Spike arrives on the bridge as Zara and Miles are confirming the autopilot. "Atuin, make sure Koi, Miles, and Spot have feeds on the pod full-time."

Koi: "Already established. We all thought it might be important."

Spike: "Great minds think alike."

Zara: "And so do ours."

Sam's voice crackles through from wherever he's stationed himself: "I heard that. I'm telling Iris you're being mean to the AIs again."

"The AIs can defend themselves," Zara says mildly, settling back in the navigator's chair as the autopilot takes over. She pulls up a holo-display, fingers dancing through data streams. "Tarsus Fringe Station. Not the worst place we've been, not the best. Neutral ground, mostly—light Protectorate presence, heavy on independent traders and people who prefer not to answer too many questions."

"So, our kind of place," you observe.

"Our kind of place," she confirms. "The trick will be finding Viktor Chenkov without advertising that we have his daughter. Fringe stations talk, and if the wrong people hear we're carrying PMC-flagged medical cargo..."

Miles chimes in: "I have seventeen potential contact points on Tarsus who might have information on Chenkov's whereabouts. Ranking them by discretion level and likelihood of cooperation."

"Eight minutes to clear scan range," Atuin reports.

Zara glances at you, one eyebrow raised. "Seventeen hours is a long time to think about what we're walking into. Want to talk strategy now, or would you rather let this simmer while we make sure we're actually clear of that patrol?"

From engineering: "Junction seven's settling down. Told you she just needed a minute to wake up properly."

"Vitals on the pod remain stable," Koi adds. "Mira Chenkov's condition unchanged."

**What do you do?**

1. **Strategy session with Zara now** - Use the burn time productively, plan the Tarsus approach
2. **Wait until you're clear of the patrol** - One crisis at a time; make sure you're safe first
3. **Go talk to Sam about the experimental equipment** - Understand all your variables before planning
4. **Something else - your call**
