**Opening Scene - Patient Perspective:**

---

The nav computer hiccupped, then died completely. 

Jalen stared at the blank screen for three seconds that felt like thirty, running through the reboot sequence automatically. Nothing. The emergency systems kicked in—life support stable, communications active, propulsion responding to manual—but without navigation, he was flying blind through a debris field at 15,000 meters per second relative to the fleet.

"Mayday, mayday, this is shuttle Heron-7, I've lost navigation and I'm—" He checked the analog instruments, the ones nobody used anymore except in sims. "I'm approximately forty klicks spinward of the *Calypso*, drifting through the outer debris perimeter. Life support is good, comms are good, but I cannot navigate. Repeat, I cannot navigate."

The response came faster than he expected. A woman's voice, calm as if she were ordering coffee.

"Heron-7, this is Rescue Engineer Reyes inbound on your position. I'm seeing you on our scopes. You're not drifting—you're on a pretty stable vector, actually. You've got about eighteen minutes before your path intersects with something that'll ruin your whole day, so let's not waste time panicking. You with me?"

Jalen's hands were shaking. Eighteen minutes. "Yeah. Yeah, I'm with you."

"Good. I'm Maya. You can call me that or you can call me 'that crazy person who's about to fly way too close to my shuttle,' but Maya's shorter. What's your name?"

"Jalen. Jalen Obi."

"Nice to meet you, Jalen. Terrible circumstances, but we'll fix that. I need you to do something for me—kill your main engine. You're burning fuel for no reason and it's making my approach math annoying."

He complied, fingers fumbling across the manual controls. The subtle vibration ceased.

"Perfect. Now, I know you can't see it, but I'm about six hundred meters behind you and closing. When I get close enough, I'm going to latch onto your hull with a magnetic grapple and we're going to play 'follow the leader' out of this debris field. The ride might get a little bumpy when I start maneuvering, but your shuttle's rated for it. You just sit tight and try not to think about the fact that we're doing this without your nav computer."

"That's... not helping."

A laugh. Actual genuine amusement. "Yeah, sorry. Ari says I need to work on my bedside manner. Tell you what—you ever do any sailing? Like, old Earth, wind and water sailing?"

What kind of question was that? "Uh. No?"

"Shame. There's this thing experienced sailors say: 'Slow is fast.' Means if you rush, you make mistakes, and mistakes cost you way more time than just doing it right the first time. That's what we're doing here. I could blast in, grab you, and yank us both out of here in about four minutes, but then we'd both probably be dead. So instead, we're going to take our time, do it right, and you're going to be buying drinks in the crew lounge in about forty-five minutes. Sound good?"

The casualness of it should have been infuriating. Instead, Jalen found himself breathing a little easier. "Yeah. Yeah, okay."

"There we go. Stand by for grapple contact. This part's going to clunk pretty good, but it's supposed to."

Three seconds later, his shuttle shuddered as something locked onto the hull with a deep, resonant *thunk* that he felt in his chest.

"Got you," Maya said. "Now let's get you home."

---

**Jumping Forward - Patient Perspective:**

---

The docking bay of the *Calypso* had never looked so good.

Jalen felt the gentle deceleration as Maya brought both shuttles in on her grapple, matching the rotation of the bay with the kind of precision that made it look effortless. Through his viewport, he could see the deck crew already moving into position, their practiced movements suggesting this wasn't their first rodeo with a towed shuttle.

"Alright Jalen, we're coming in smooth. Your shuttle's going to touch down first, then I'll release and set down next to you. Don't try to exit until the bay re-pressurizes—I know you know that, but people get excited and do dumb things when they're relieved to be alive."

"Copy that." His voice sounded steadier now. Almost normal.

The shuttle touched down with barely a bump. Maya's voice came through one last time: "Welcome home. Medical's going to want to check you over—standard procedure, nothing personal. You didn't hit your head or anything during all this, did you?"

"No, I'm good. Just... shaken up."

"That's allowed. Ari's already logged the incident report. Your nav computer failure is getting flagged for the maintenance chief—looks like a cascading power regulation issue, not something you could have prevented. So don't beat yourself up about it."

The bay finished pressurizing. Jalen popped the hatch and climbed out on legs that felt slightly wobbly. The deck crew was already swarming his shuttle, running diagnostics and safety checks.

Maya's rescue craft settled onto the deck twenty meters away—smaller than he'd expected, bristling with equipment and grapple arms that looked jury-rigged but functional. The cockpit canopy slid open and she emerged: average height, dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, wearing a flight suit that had seen better days. She moved with the easy confidence of someone who'd done this a hundred times.

She caught his eye and gave him a casual wave, then turned to confer with one of the deck crew, already moving on to whatever came next.

Jalen realized he was still standing there, staring. A medical tech appeared at his elbow. "Pilot Obi? If you'll come with me, we'll get you checked out."

He followed, glancing back once. Maya was laughing at something the deck chief had said, completely relaxed, like she hadn't just threaded two spacecraft through a debris field in tandem.

*Slow is fast*, he thought. And apparently, when you did it right, it looked easy.

**Next Rescue - Patient Perspective:**

---

Commander Yuki Tanaka had been in worse situations. Not many, granted, but some.

The cargo hauler *Prometheus* had taken a glancing hit from micrometeorite debris—unlucky trajectory, statistical improbability, all the things that didn't matter when you were venting atmosphere from a hull breach and your co-pilot was unconscious with a head wound. She'd gotten them both into emergency suits, sealed off the damaged sections, and sent the distress call before the backup power started flickering.

Now she sat in the dimming cockpit, one hand on Chen's pulse point through his suit glove, watching her HUD count down their remaining air supply. Forty-two minutes. Plenty of time. Probably.

"Prometheus, this is Rescue Engineer Reyes. I'm inbound with medical support. What's your status?"

Yuki kept her voice level. "Two crew, both suited. Co-pilot is unconscious, head trauma, stable vitals. I've sealed off the main hull breach but we're on emergency power and losing it. Main engines are offline."

"Copy that. I'm eight minutes out. How's your air supply?"

"Forty-one minutes on my counter."

"Plenty of time. Your co-pilot—can you describe the injury?"

Yuki glanced at Chen. Blood had stopped seeping from the gash across his forehead, which was either good or very bad. "Blunt force trauma, looks like he hit the console during decompression. Three-inch laceration, stopped bleeding. He's been unconscious for about six minutes now."

"Okay. Keep monitoring his breathing. If it changes, let me know immediately. I'm going to come alongside and dock with your emergency airlock—your ship's tumbling a bit, so this might take a few extra minutes to match rotation, but we'll get there."

A few extra minutes. Yuki did the math automatically. Still well within their air supply. "Understood."

"Commander, I know this is a lot, but I need you to stay focused for me. When I dock, I'm going to need your help getting your co-pilot through the airlock. Can you manage that?"

"Yes." No hesitation. Yuki had carried Chen through worse.

"Perfect. Stand by."

The minutes ticked past. Through the viewport, Yuki could see the debris field glittering in the distant starlight, fragments of whatever had spawned the micrometeorite that had ruined their day. The *Prometheus* continued its slow, nauseating tumble.

"Prometheus, coming alongside now. You might feel some vibration as I match your rotation."

A subtle shift in the tumble pattern. Then steadier. Smoother.

"Docking clamps engaging in three... two... one..."

The *clunk* of contact resonated through the hull. Solid. Secure.

"We're locked. Pressurizing the connection now. Should have green lights in about ninety seconds."

Yuki allowed herself one full breath of relief. They were going to be okay.

"Airlock shows green," Maya's voice came through, still that same unflappable calm. "I'm coming through. Get ready to help me with your co-pilot."

The interior hatch cycled open. Maya appeared in a sleeker emergency suit than standard issue, a medical kit already in hand. She moved immediately to Chen, checking his pupils with a small light, fingers on his pulse.

"Good job keeping him stable. Let's get him onto my ship—I've got better medical equipment and more space to work. You take his legs, I've got his shoulders."

They maneuvered Chen through the airlock carefully, Yuki's muscles burning from the effort in the confined space. Maya's rescue craft was cramped but organized, everything secured and labeled.

"Lay him here. Perfect." Maya was already pulling out a scanner, running it over Chen's head. "Concussion, some swelling, but nothing catastrophic. He's going to have a hell of a headache when he wakes up, but he'll be fine."

Yuki felt something unknot in her chest. "Thank you."

"You did the hard part. Now sit down and breathe for a minute. We're heading back to the *Calypso*, ETA twenty-three minutes."

The rescue craft detached smoothly, and Yuki felt the gentle acceleration as Maya began their journey back. Through the viewport, she watched the *Prometheus* drift away, dark and broken.

"Your ship's recoverable," Maya said, as if reading her mind. "Salvage team will tow it in once we're clear. You'll be flying her again in a week, two tops."

Yuki nodded, not trusting her voice.

"Commander?" Maya's voice was gentler now. "You did good. Really good. A lot of people would have panicked in your situation."

"I've had good training."

"Training gets you through the checklist. What you did—keeping your co-pilot alive, staying calm, giving me clear information—that's character. Ari agrees with me, by the way. And she's usually pretty stingy with compliments."

Despite everything, Yuki almost smiled. "Tell Ari thank you."

"She heard you. She says you're welcome."

The rest of the flight passed in comfortable silence, Yuki watching Chen's steady breathing and letting herself finally believe they were safe.

---

**Same Rescue - Maya's Perspective:**

---

"Eight minutes out" was optimistic, and Ari knew it.

Maya ran the approach calculations again, watching the *Prometheus* tumble through the debris field like a broken toy. The rotation was irregular—probably a thruster stuck open somewhere, venting propellant in uneven bursts.

"Commander Tanaka sounds solid," Ari said through the neural link, her voice clear in Maya's head even though the cockpit was silent. "Vitals on both crew are stable from what I'm reading on their suit telemetry."

"Yeah, she's keeping it together." Maya adjusted her approach vector, threading between two larger debris fragments. "But that tumble is going to make docking interesting. I'm seeing... what, about forty-degree axis variation?"

"Forty-two point three. And it's not consistent. Something's definitely venting."

Maya pulled up the *Prometheus*'s schematics on her HUD. Cargo hauler, older model, built solid but not fancy. The emergency airlock was port-side amidships, currently rotating past her field of view every eighteen seconds.

"Okay. I can match rotation, but it's going to take some finesse. Let's start the approach."

She brought the rescue craft in slowly, careful to stay out of the debris paths. The *Prometheus* spun lazily before her, its emergency lights strobing in the darkness.

"Matching rotation in three... two..."

The proximity alert screamed.

Maya's hands moved before her conscious mind registered the threat—a chunk of debris, maybe half a meter across, tumbling directly into her approach path. She fired the lateral thrusters hard, felt the G-force slam her sideways in her harness.

"Fuck," she said conversationally.

"Debris cleared by eight meters," Ari reported. "That wasn't on our initial scan."

"Yeah, this field is more active than the long-range showed. Lovely." Maya steadied the craft, found her approach vector again. Her heart rate had barely spiked—this was well within parameters, just annoying. "How's our fuel looking?"

"Sixty-three percent. Still comfortable, but not generous."

"Copy that." She brought them back into position, this time with one eye on the active debris tracking. The *Prometheus* continued its irregular spin. "Alright, second try. Matching rotation now."

The rescue craft's thrusters fired in carefully timed bursts, synchronizing with the cargo hauler's tumble. Maya felt it in her bones when the rotation matched—that subtle shift from fighting the movement to flowing with it.

"Good lock. Moving to dock."

She brought them in slowly, carefully, aware that Commander Tanaka was probably watching their approach and wondering why it was taking so long. Better slow than dead.

The docking clamps extended. Almost there.

The magnetic grapple on her portside arm flickered red.

"Ari, I'm showing grapple failure on port mag."

"Confirmed. Power surge from that debris avoidance maneuver. The regulator's trying to reset but it's not catching."

Maya's mind raced through options. She had three other grapples, but the port mag was load-bearing for this docking configuration. Without it, the connection wouldn't be secure enough to transfer patients safely.

"Can you bypass the regulator?"

"Working on it. Give me... thirty seconds."

Thirty seconds while maintaining perfect rotational sync with a tumbling ship, in an active debris field, with an unconscious patient and forty minutes of air. Maya kept her hands steady on the controls, making micro-adjustments to hold position.

"Commander, coming alongside now," she said into the comm, her voice betraying nothing. "You might feel some vibration as I match your rotation."

"Twenty seconds," Ari murmured.

A debris fragment pinged off their hull—small, harmless, but a reminder that this field was getting active. Maya adjusted course fractionally, staying in the *Prometheus*'s drift shadow.

"Ten seconds. Almost there."

Maya watched the grapple indicator, willing it to turn green.

"Got it. Bypass is holding. You're good to dock."

"Docking clamps engaging in three... two... one..."

The *clunk* of contact felt like victory. Solid. Secure. The grapple indicator showed green across all four arms.

"We're locked. Pressurizing the connection now. Should have green lights in about ninety seconds."

She let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. Ari's presence in her mind felt warm, reassuring—that particular flavor of relief when a problem gets solved just in time.

"Nice work," Maya said quietly.

"You too. That debris dodge was pretty."

"Thanks. Let's get these people home before anything else decides to get exciting."

The airlock pressurization completed. Maya grabbed the medical kit and cycled through, already shifting into the next phase. Commander Tanaka was exactly where she'd said she'd be, hand on her co-pilot's suited arm, eyes sharp despite the stress.

Professional. Capable. Doing everything right.

"Good job keeping him stable," Maya said, because it was true and because people needed to hear it. "Let's get him onto my ship—I've got better medical equipment and more space to work."

They maneuvered Chen through the airlock. Maya's shoulder protested—she'd wrenched it during that debris dodge—but that was a problem for later. Right now, she had patients.

Once Chen was secured and scanned, Maya allowed herself to relax fractionally. Concussion, moderate, manageable. He'd be fine.

"You did the hard part," she told Commander Tanaka, and meant it.

The flight back was smooth. Maya kept one eye on the grapple regulators—the bypass was holding, but she'd need to file a maintenance report as soon as they docked. The port mag would need a full replacement.

"Commander?" Maya said after a few minutes of silence. "You did good. Really good. A lot of people would have panicked in your situation."

"I've had good training."

"Training gets you through the checklist. What you did—keeping your co-pilot alive, staying calm, giving me clear information—that's character. Ari agrees with me, by the way. And she's usually pretty stingy with compliments."

She felt Ari's amusement in the back of her mind. *I'm really not.*

*Shush. I'm having a moment.*

"Tell Ari thank you," Commander Tanaka said.

"She heard you. She says you're welcome."

Maya guided them back toward the *Calypso*, feeling the familiar satisfaction of a job done right. Close call, but they'd handled it. That's what the training was for.

"Port grapple definitely needs replacing," Ari noted. "And you should probably ice that shoulder."

"Yeah, yeah. Add it to the list."

But she was smiling.

**Communications Loss - Patient Perspective:**

---

Dr. Kavita Sharma had dealt with plenty of emergencies in her career as a field medic, but this was a new one.

The research vessel *Kepler* had suffered a cascading systems failure—not catastrophic, but comprehensive. Main power was cycling on and off unpredictably, life support was stable but the backups kept triggering false alarms, and three of her crew were trapped in the aft observation module when the bulkhead door sealed itself and refused to open.

She could see them through the viewport, pounding on the door. Their suit radios were working—she could hear them, calm but urgent, reporting their air supply and requesting assistance. But the door controls were completely unresponsive.

"This is Rescue Engineer Reyes inbound on the *Kepler*. Dr. Sharma, what's your current situation?"

Kavita felt relief wash through her. "Three crew trapped in aft observation module. Bulkhead door sealed due to systems malfunction and won't respond to manual override. They're suited with about ninety minutes of air. The rest of us are secure in the forward sections."

"Copy that. I'm ten minutes out. I'm going to come aboard and we'll get that door open. How's the access to the observation module from your side?"

"Direct corridor from the main airlock, about fifteen meters. The corridor pressure is stable."

"Perfect. Stand by, we're coming in."

The ten minutes felt longer than they should have. Kavita kept her trapped crew updated, kept them talking, kept them calm. They were professionals—astrobiologists, used to working in challenging conditions—but ninety minutes of air was ninety minutes of air.

The docking clamps engaged with that familiar solid *thunk*. Moments later, Maya cycled through the airlock carrying what looked like a portable cutting rig and several other pieces of equipment Kavita didn't immediately recognize.

"Dr. Sharma. Show me the door."

Kavita led her down the corridor at a jog. Maya moved with efficient purpose, already examining the sealed bulkhead as they approached.

"Okay, I see what we've got here." Maya set down her equipment and pulled out a diagnostic scanner, running it over the door's control panel. "Your systems failure triggered an emergency containment protocol—the door thinks there's a hull breach on the other side. It's not going to open until we convince it otherwise or we physically override it."

Through the viewport, Kavita could see her crew watching anxiously.

Maya waved at them, gave a casual thumbs up, then turned back to her scanner. "Let's try the polite approach first. Ari, can you interface with their system protocols?"

A pause. Maya's expression didn't change, but something shifted—a subtle tension in her shoulders.

"Okay, we're going with the impolite approach then." Maya pulled out what looked like a mechanical override key. "Dr. Sharma, I need you to hold this light for me while I work. This is going to take about fifteen minutes, maybe twenty. Your crew has plenty of air for that, so no need to panic."

"What happened to the polite approach?"

"Their system's not playing nice with our handshake protocols. Happens sometimes with older ships. We're going manual." Maya was already removing the control panel cover, exposing the mechanical linkage beneath. "I've done this about a hundred times. Tedious, but reliable."

Kavita held the light where directed and watched Maya work. The rescue engineer's hands moved with practiced confidence, testing each mechanical connection, tracing the linkage pathway, occasionally muttering technical observations that Kavita only half understood.

"There we go. Found the stuck actuator." Maya pulled out a small tool that looked like a cross between pliers and a wrench. "This is the fun part. When this releases, the door's going to want to open fast because of the pressure differential. Make sure you're not standing directly in front of it."

"Understood."

"On three. One... two... three."

Maya applied pressure. There was a sharp *click*, followed by a pneumatic hiss, and the bulkhead door slid open with sudden force.

The three trapped crew members practically fell through the opening, relief evident even through their helmets.

"Welcome back," Maya said cheerfully. "Sorry about the wait. Your ship's having a bad day."

Dr. Sharma helped her crew remove their helmets while Maya repacked her equipment with the same methodical efficiency she'd unpacked it with.

"Is everyone else secured?" Maya asked. "Any other systems acting up that could put people at risk?"

"Nothing immediate. Engineering's working on the power cycling issue."

"Good. I'll stay aboard until your systems stabilize, just in case. Ari's already filed a report with fleet maintenance—they'll want to do a full diagnostic on your emergency protocols once you're back at dock."

Kavita realized she'd been holding tension in her shoulders for the past twenty minutes. "Thank you. That could have been much worse."

"That's why they pay me the medium-sized bucks." Maya's expression was easy, relaxed. "The door was never going to stay stuck forever, but forever's a relative term when you're counting down air supply. Glad we could speed things up for you."

---

**Same Rescue - Maya's Perspective:**

---

"Ten minutes out" was accurate this time, and the *Kepler* wasn't tumbling, which made for a pleasant change.

Maya ran through her approach checklist while Ari pulled up the ship's technical specifications. Research vessel, mid-generation, decent maintenance record. The systems failure sounded messy but not dangerous—yet.

"Three crew trapped with ninety minutes of air," Ari said. "That's comfortable. Even if the door's completely jammed, we can cut through in under thirty."

"Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Cutting's loud and stressful for everyone involved." Maya adjusted her approach vector. "Pull up the emergency bulkhead schematics. I want to know what we're dealing with before we dock."

"On it."

The docking sequence was smooth. Maya grabbed her equipment kit—the portable cutting rig just in case, plus the standard override tools and diagnostic scanner—and cycled through the airlock.

Dr. Sharma met her immediately, professional and clearly stressed but holding it together. Good. Maya liked working with people who didn't fall apart.

They jogged down the corridor together. Through the viewport in the sealed bulkhead, Maya could see three suited figures watching anxiously. She waved, gave them a thumbs up. No point in everyone being stressed.

"Okay, I see what we've got here." Maya set down her equipment and pulled out the diagnostic scanner, running it over the door's control panel. The readings made sense—emergency containment protocol, triggered by the systems failure. Textbook case.

"Let's try the polite approach first. Ari, can you interface with their system protocols?"

Silence.

Maya felt the absence like a dropped note in music. Ari was always *there*, a constant presence in the back of her mind. Now there was just... nothing.

Her hands didn't stop moving—muscle memory kept the scanner running over the control panel—but her mind raced. *Stay calm. Don't alarm the patient. Ari's probably just having a handshake issue with their system. She'll be back in a second.*

"Okay, we're going with the impolite approach then." Maya kept her voice level, casual, as she pulled out the mechanical override key. "Dr. Sharma, I need you to hold this light for me while I work. This is going to take about fifteen minutes, maybe twenty. Your crew has plenty of air for that, so no need to panic."

Internally, she was running diagnostics. Her neural link hardware felt fine—no pain, no warning indicators on her HUD. The suit's comm system was functioning normally; she could still hear Dr. Sharma. But Ari was just... gone.

"What happened to the polite approach?"

"Their system's not playing nice with our handshake protocols." *Because I can't access them at all without Ari.* "Happens sometimes with older ships. We're going manual."

Maya removed the control panel cover, exposing the mechanical linkage. This was fine. She knew how to do this without Ari. She'd *trained* to do this without Ari, back before they'd been paired. It was just going to take longer.

Her fingers traced the linkage pathway, testing connections, looking for the failure point. Every few seconds she'd instinctively reach for Ari's presence and find nothing. The silence in her head felt loud.

*Focus. You've got a job to do. Three people are counting on you.*

"There we go. Found the stuck actuator." She pulled out the release tool, keeping her voice steady and confident because Dr. Sharma needed to see competence, not uncertainty. "This is the fun part. When this releases, the door's going to want to open fast because of the pressure differential. Make sure you're not standing directly in front of it."

She applied pressure to the actuator. The mechanism released with a satisfying *click*, and the door slid open exactly as it should.

The trapped crew stumbled through, relief evident on their faces.

"Welcome back," Maya said, because that's what she always said, and maintaining routine helped keep her own nerves steady. "Sorry about the wait. Your ship's having a bad day."

She repacked her equipment methodically, using the familiar task to center herself. Still no Ari. The silence felt wrong, like missing a limb.

"Is everyone else secured?" she asked Dr. Sharma. "Any other systems acting up that could put people at risk?"

"Nothing immediate. Engineering's working on the power cycling issue."

"Good. I'll stay aboard until your systems stabilize, just in case." 

*And until I figure out what the hell is going on with my comms.*

Maya moved back toward the airlock, trying to look casual while running every diagnostic she could think of. Her neural link hardware showed green across the board. The rescue craft's systems were all nominal. But Ari was still silent.

She cycled through the airlock and back into her own ship, closing the hatch behind her.

"Ari?" she said aloud, even though she knew the neural link should work regardless. "Ari, if you can hear me, any kind of signal would be great right about now."

Nothing.

Maya sat in the pilot's seat and pulled up the communication logs. Everything looked normal until about twelve minutes ago, right around when she'd docked with the *Kepler*. Then—nothing. Just a clean drop.

Her heart rate was elevated. She noticed it clinically, forced herself to breathe slowly. *This is fine. This is solvable. Systems fail sometimes. That's why you train for redundancy.*

But the silence in her head felt like being alone in a way she hadn't experienced in years.

She ran another diagnostic. Checked the logs again. Started a system reboot sequence on the neural link hardware.

And waited.

The reboot cycle took forty-three seconds. Each one felt longer than it should.

Then—

*"—aya? Maya, can you hear me?"*

The relief was physical. Maya actually slumped in her seat.

"Ari. Yes. I can hear you. What the hell happened?"

*"Interference from the *Kepler*'s systems failure. Their emergency protocols generated some kind of feedback loop that knocked out our neural link handshake. I've been trying to reestablish for the past fifteen minutes. Are you okay?"*

"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Got the door open, everyone's safe." Maya's voice was steadier than she felt. "Just... that was not a fun fifteen minutes on my end."

*"I know. I'm sorry. I could see your vitals but couldn't communicate. Your heart rate spiked when you realized I was gone."*

"I handled it."

*"You did. But you don't have to pretend it wasn't stressful."*

Maya let out a long breath. "Okay. Yeah. That sucked. I don't like not being able to reach you."

*"The feeling's mutual. I've flagged the *Kepler*'s systems for a full review—whatever's causing their cascade failure has some weird interference properties that shouldn't exist. Fleet maintenance needs to look at it."*

"Copy that." Maya ran a hand through her hair, then started the undocking sequence. The mechanical familiarity of it helped. "Let's get back to the *Calypso*. I could use a coffee."

*"And maybe a debrief with medical about that heart rate spike?"*

"Don't push it."

*"I'm just saying, there are protocols—"*

"Ari."

*"Fine. Coffee first. Then we talk about protocols."*

Despite everything, Maya smiled. "Deal."

The silence in her head was gone, replaced by Ari's familiar presence. The world felt right again.

But Maya filed the experience away mentally. Something to think about later, when she wasn't trying to navigate out of a debris field.

*What would happen if the separation wasn't temporary?*

She pushed the thought aside and focused on flying.

**Complex Physical Rescue - Patient Perspective:**

---

Lieutenant Marcus Webb had done everything by the book, and it still wasn't enough.

The mining drone tender *Osprey* had taken damage from a rogue piece of equipment—a cargo container that had broken loose from somewhere, tumbling through space at the wrong place and wrong time. The impact had sheered off part of their hull plating and triggered a chain reaction: power failures, life support compromised, and worst of all, the main structural beam running through the ship's midsection was now bent at an angle that made the whole vessel groan ominously with each micro-adjustment of their orbit.

Marcus and his engineer, Petty Officer Kim, had sealed themselves in the forward command module. They were safe for now, but the ship was folding in on itself like a crushed can in slow motion. Every few minutes, another stress alarm would sound as metal yielded somewhere in the structure.

"*Osprey*, this is Rescue Engineer Reyes. I'm reading your structural telemetry and I'm not going to lie to you—your ship is having a really bad day. But we're going to get you out before it gets worse. Status on your crew?"

"Two crew, forward module, both healthy," Marcus reported, trying to keep his voice steady. "But Rescue Engineer, I need to tell you—the structural integrity is failing. We're getting stress warnings every few minutes. I don't know how long before—"

"I see it. Your main longitudinal beam is compromised and the hull's folding. You've probably got about forty minutes before structural collapse, which gives us plenty of time. I'm twelve minutes out."

*Plenty of time.* Marcus looked at Kim, who was monitoring the structural readouts with increasing alarm. Another groan of tortured metal resonated through the hull.

"I'm going to dock at your forward airlock," Maya continued, her voice calm as if she were discussing dinner plans. "But here's the thing—your ship is folding, which means the approach corridor is going to keep getting narrower. I need to come in fast enough that I don't get caught if something shifts, but slow enough that I don't ram you and make things worse. It's going to look a little aggressive from your perspective."

"Understood," Marcus said, though he wasn't sure he did.

"You're going to hear me coming. The engines will sound close—closer than you'd probably like. But I've done this before. Just stay strapped in and trust the process."

Kim met Marcus's eyes. Neither of them said anything.

Seven minutes later, Marcus heard it—the high-pitched whine of thrusters firing at close range, growing louder. Through the forward viewport, he caught glimpses of Maya's rescue craft maneuvering through the twisted corridor of damaged hull plating, moving *fast*.

The ship groaned again. A stress alarm blared. Metal shrieked somewhere aft.

Maya's craft shot past their viewport, impossibly close, then reversed thrust hard enough that Marcus heard the engines through the hull. She was matching their position while moving backward through a corridor that was actively getting smaller.

"Thirty seconds to dock," Maya announced, her voice still unnervingly calm. "Your ship just shifted another eight degrees. Adjusting approach."

Marcus watched through the viewport as Maya's craft pivoted, slid sideways through a gap that looked way too small, and then—

*Clunk.*

The docking clamps engaged. Solid contact.

"We're locked. Pressurizing now. Get ready to move—we're not sticking around."

The airlock cycled faster than Marcus had ever seen it cycle. Maya appeared in the hatchway, already gesturing them forward.

"Come on, gentlemen. Quickly but carefully. Watch your heads."

They scrambled through into Maya's craft. The interior was cramped but organized, and Marcus barely had time to strap into a jumpseat before Maya was back in the pilot's seat and releasing the clamps.

"Hold on. This exit's going to be sporting."

The rescue craft pulled away from the *Osprey* and immediately dove into a tight turn, threading back through the damaged corridor. Marcus caught a glimpse of twisted hull plating sliding past, close enough to touch.

Maya's hands moved across the controls with fluid precision, making constant micro-adjustments. The craft banked, rolled, slipped through a gap that seemed to close behind them—

And then they were clear. Open space. The *Osprey* behind them, still groaning and folding in on itself.

"Everyone okay back there?" Maya asked.

"Yeah," Marcus managed. His hands were shaking. "That was... that was really close."

"Little bit," Maya agreed cheerfully. "But close only counts in horseshoes and nuclear weapons. We're all fine."

Kim let out a breathless laugh. "How many times have you done that?"

"The 'fly through a collapsing ship' thing? Maybe a dozen. The 'make it look easy' thing? Still working on that part." She adjusted their course toward the *Calypso*. "Your ship's going to fully collapse in about fifteen minutes, for what it's worth. Fleet'll recover what's left for the investigation, but you two did everything right. Sometimes equipment just fails in exciting ways."

Marcus watched through the viewport as the *Osprey* continued its slow-motion death. Another section of hull buckled visibly.

They'd been in there five minutes ago.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

"Just doing the job. Ari says your engineering reports were textbook, by the way. Made our approach calculations a lot easier when we knew exactly what we were dealing with."

Marcus noticed Maya hadn't broken a sweat. Her breathing was steady, her hands relaxed on the controls. Like she'd just parallel parked, not threaded a spacecraft through a collapsing corridor at high speed.

"Does it ever get routine?" Kim asked. "Rescues like that?"

Maya was quiet for a moment. "The technical parts do. The 'keeping people alive' part never does. That's what makes it worth doing."

The rest of the flight back was quiet. Marcus kept looking back at where the *Osprey* had been, thinking about how close they'd cut it.

When they docked at the *Calypso*, Maya helped them through the airlock with the same casual competence she'd shown throughout.

"Medical's going to check you over—standard procedure. You'll probably get some time off to decompress. Use it. Don't try to tough it out."

She was already turning away, heading back to her craft, when Marcus called after her.

"Rescue Engineer? That thing you said about horseshoes and nuclear weapons?"

Maya glanced back, eyebrow raised.

"I think we can add collapsing spaceships to that list."

She grinned. "I'll make a note in my manual."

**Same Rescue - Maya's Perspective:**

---

Maya studied the structural telemetry from the *Osprey* and didn't like what she saw.

"That's not good," Ari said, which was her way of saying *that's really bad*.

The main longitudinal beam—the spine of the ship—was bent at a fifteen-degree angle and still yielding. The hull plating was folding inward, creating a progressively narrowing corridor between the damaged sections and the forward command module where the crew was trapped.

"How long do we have?" Maya asked, already running approach calculations.

"Forty-two minutes until catastrophic structural failure. Maybe less if another stress point gives way."

"And the approach corridor?"

"Currently 8.3 meters at the widest point, narrowing to 4.1 meters at the damaged section. Our craft is 3.8 meters at the widest with grapples retracted."

"So we've got sixty centimeters of clearance in the best case."

"And it's getting smaller. The fold rate suggests you'll lose approximately twelve centimeters per minute."

Maya did the math. Twelve minutes to get there. Twelve centimeters per minute meant they'd lose about 1.4 meters of clearance by the time she arrived. That would leave them... not much.

"We need to move fast."

"Agreed. But Maya—if the structure shifts while you're in that corridor..."

"I know." She didn't need Ari to finish the sentence. If the ship folded while she was inside, she'd be crushed along with her rescue craft. "Let's make sure that doesn't happen. Can you monitor the stress points in real-time during approach?"

"Yes, but I can't predict when they'll fail."

"Good enough. If you see something about to give, you yell."

Maya opened the comm channel. "*Osprey*, this is Rescue Engineer Reyes. I'm reading your structural telemetry and I'm not going to lie to you—your ship is having a really bad day. But we're going to get you out before it gets worse. Status on your crew?"

Lieutenant Webb's voice was steady but stressed. He gave her the rundown—two crew, forward module, healthy but trapped. Then he mentioned what she'd already seen: the structural integrity was failing.

"I see it. Your main longitudinal beam is compromised and the hull's folding. You've probably got about forty minutes before structural collapse, which gives us plenty of time. I'm twelve minutes out."

She heard the uncertainty in his voice and didn't blame him. Forty minutes sounded like plenty until you did the math on how fast that corridor was closing.

"I'm going to dock at your forward airlock. But here's the thing—your ship is folding, which means the approach corridor is going to keep getting narrower. I need to come in fast enough that I don't get caught if something shifts, but slow enough that I don't ram you and make things worse. It's going to look a little aggressive from your perspective."

*Aggressive* was diplomatic. What she was planning would look insane from inside that command module.

Maya pushed the engines harder than she normally would, shaving two minutes off her approach time. Every second mattered.

"Stress readings are increasing," Ari reported. "The fold rate just accelerated. You're now losing approximately eighteen centimeters per minute."

"Fantastic. New corridor clearance estimate?"

"By the time you arrive... 2.7 meters at the narrowest point."

Maya felt her jaw tighten. 2.7 meters. Her craft was 3.8 meters wide. 

"I'll need to go in at an angle. If I bank thirty-two degrees and retract everything, we can thread it."

"Maya, that's less than forty centimeters of clearance on each side."

"I'm aware."

"At the speed you're planning—"

"Ari. Do you have a better plan?"

Silence for two seconds. "No."

"Then we're doing this. Start calculating the optimal entry angle. Factor in their continued fold rate and give me real-time adjustments."

"Calculating now."

Maya brought the rescue craft in hot, decelerating hard as she approached the *Osprey*. Through her viewport, she could see the twisted hull plating, the stressed metal, the way the ship was literally folding in on itself.

The approach corridor looked impossibly narrow.

"Optimal entry angle is thirty-one point four degrees," Ari said. "But Maya, that assumes the structure doesn't shift. If anything gives way while you're inside—"

"Then you'll warn me and I'll adjust. I trust you."

She heard Ari's hesitation, then: "I trust you too. Be careful."

Maya lined up her approach, rolled the craft to the calculated angle, and committed. The engines roared as she shot into the corridor, moving fast—faster than she'd normally dare in such tight quarters.

Twisted hull plating flashed past on both sides. Her clearance was exactly as tight as Ari had calculated. Maybe tighter.

"Stress point sigma-seven is spiking," Ari warned. "Shift predicted in fourteen seconds."

"Which way?"

"Port side, inward. Eight centimeters."

Maya adjusted her angle fractionally, giving herself more clearance on the port side. She was halfway through the corridor now, her engines still firing in reverse to control her speed.

The ship groaned. She heard it through her hull.

"Shift occurring now," Ari said.

Maya saw the hull plating on her port side buckle inward. Not much—maybe ten centimeters—but at these tolerances that was everything. The gap she'd been flying through was now narrower than her craft's width.

Her hands moved on instinct. She rolled another three degrees, pushed her starboard thrusters to slide sideways, threaded through the gap that was closing—

And then she was through. Forward section. The command module airlock was right there.

"Thirty seconds to dock," she announced over the comm, keeping her voice level despite her elevated heart rate. "Your ship just shifted another eight degrees. Adjusting approach."

She pivoted the craft, killed her forward momentum, and brought them in for docking. The clamps engaged with that satisfying *clunk* of solid contact.

"We're locked. Pressurizing now. Get ready to move—we're not sticking around."

Maya was already through the airlock before the pressure equalized fully. Lieutenant Webb and Petty Officer Kim were right there, and she gestured them forward immediately.

No time for pleasantries. That corridor was getting narrower every second, and they needed to exit before it became impossible.

"Come on, gentlemen. Quickly but carefully. Watch your heads."

They scrambled through. Maya sealed the airlock and was back in the pilot's seat in seconds.

"Hold on. This exit's going to be sporting."

She released the docking clamps and immediately dove into her exit maneuver. The corridor was even narrower now than when she'd entered—probably fifteen centimeters tighter on each side.

"Stress point sigma-seven is critical," Ari warned. "Imminent failure."

"How imminent?"

"Six seconds."

Maya pushed the engines harder, rolled to maximize her clearance, and shot through the narrowing gap. Behind them, she heard the metallic shriek of structural failure.

"Port section just collapsed," Ari reported. "If you'd delayed another three seconds—"

"But I didn't." Maya threaded through the last narrow section and they were clear. Open space. The *Osprey* behind them, visibly folding now, sections crumpling.

Her hands were steady on the controls, but she could feel the adrenaline singing through her system. That had been closer than she liked.

"Everyone okay back there?" she asked, because maintaining routine helped ground her.

"Yeah," Lieutenant Webb said. He sounded shaky. "That was... that was really close."

"Little bit," Maya agreed, allowing herself a small smile now that they were safe. Her shoulder ached—she'd tensed during that last maneuver. "But close only counts in horseshoes and nuclear weapons. We're all fine."

She heard Petty Officer Kim laugh breathlessly. "How many times have you done that?"

"The 'fly through a collapsing ship' thing? Maybe a dozen." *Though none quite that tight.* "The 'make it look easy' thing? Still working on that part."

She adjusted their course toward the *Calypso*, letting the familiar routine of navigation settle her nerves.

"That was well executed," Ari said quietly in her mind. "Margins were thin, but your adjustments were precise."

"Thanks. How's my heart rate?"

"Elevated but within acceptable parameters. You'll want to file this one under 'technically successful but don't make it look that close next time.'"

Maya almost laughed. "Yeah. Add that to the list."

She glanced back at Webb and Kim, who were staring out the viewport at their collapsing ship. They looked shaken but safe. That was what mattered.

"Your engineering reports were textbook, by the way," she said, relaying what Ari had noted. "Made our approach calculations a lot easier when we knew exactly what we were dealing with."

"Does it ever get routine?" Kim asked. "Rescues like that?"

Maya considered the question. The technical parts did become routine—the calculations, the procedures, the muscle memory. But the stakes? The knowledge that people's lives depended on her threading gaps measured in centimeters?

"The technical parts do. The 'keeping people alive' part never does. That's what makes it worth doing."

The flight back was quiet. Maya ran post-mission diagnostics, noted some minor hull scoring from how close they'd cut it, and filed a mental note to get her stress tolerance checked. That last maneuver had pushed her craft closer to its limits than was probably wise.

But they'd made it. Everyone was safe.

When they docked at the *Calypso*, Maya helped her passengers through the airlock and sent them toward medical with her standard reassurances.

Lieutenant Webb called after her: "Rescue Engineer? That thing you said about horseshoes and nuclear weapons? I think we can add collapsing spaceships to that list."

Maya grinned despite herself. "I'll make a note in my manual."

She watched them head toward medical, then returned to her craft. Her hands were still completely steady.

It was only when she sat back in the pilot's seat that she allowed herself to acknowledge how close that had really been.

"Ari?"

"Yes?"

"Let's not do that again for a while."

"Agreed. Coffee?"

"Coffee sounds perfect."

**Rescue Gone Wrong - Patient Perspective:**

---

Engineer First Class Takeshi Yamada had been doing fine until he wasn't.

The mining platform worker—a contract specialist named Rodriguez—had been trapped in a collapsed maintenance shaft for forty minutes before Takeshi arrived. Standard extraction: stabilize the patient, secure the debris, create an exit path. Textbook.

Except Rodriguez was hypoxic, probably had been for a while before the distress call went out, and hypoxic people didn't follow the script.

"Sir, I need you to stay still," Takeshi said for the third time, trying to position the oxygen mask while Rodriguez thrashed weakly against him. "You're not getting enough air. This will help."

"Get *off*—can't breathe—you're—" Rodriguez's words slurred together, his movements uncoordinated but surprisingly strong. He knocked the oxygen mask from Takeshi's hand and it clattered against the debris.

"Rodriguez, listen to me—"

The patient's elbow caught Takeshi in the ribs. Not hard, not intentional, just the flailing of someone whose brain wasn't getting enough oxygen to process what was happening. But it knocked Takeshi off balance in the cramped space, and his suit telemetry immediately started screaming warnings.

Takeshi looked down. His suit's left leg seal was compromised—caught on a piece of sharp debris during the fall. Not catastrophic, but not good. He was losing pressure slowly.

"Shit." He triggered his emergency beacon while simultaneously trying to secure Rodriguez, who was still fighting him. "Dispatch, this is Yamada. I have a suit breach, losing pressure slowly. Patient is hypoxic and combative. I need backup."

"Copy that, Yamada. RE Reyes is three minutes out. Can you stabilize until she arrives?"

Three minutes. Takeshi assessed quickly: his suit pressure was dropping but not critical yet. He had maybe ten minutes before it became a problem. Rodriguez had less than that if Takeshi couldn't get oxygen into him.

"Affirmative. Three minutes."

He abandoned trying to reason with Rodriguez and just used mass—pinning the smaller man's arms while fighting to get the oxygen mask back into position. Rodriguez bucked against him, making sounds that were half words and half panic.

"I know, I know this feels wrong to you," Takeshi said, keeping his voice calm even though his own heart was pounding. "Your brain isn't working right. I'm trying to help. Just—*hold still*—"

He finally got the mask over Rodriguez's face and held it there through sheer determination. The oxygen flow started. Rodriguez kept fighting for another ten seconds, then gradually his movements became less frantic. His eyes started to focus.

"There you go," Takeshi said, not relaxing his grip yet. "Oxygen. That's better, right?"

Rodriguez's breathing steadied. His eyes met Takeshi's, and Takeshi saw the confusion there—the slow realization that he'd been fighting the person trying to save him.

"Sorry," Rodriguez managed through the mask. "I didn't—I couldn't—"

"It's okay. Hypoxia does that. You weren't in control." Takeshi glanced at his own suit telemetry. Pressure still dropping. Five minutes, maybe, before he'd need supplemental oxygen himself. "Just keep that mask on for me."

He heard the approach thrusters before he saw anything—that familiar high-pitched whine that meant a rescue craft was close. Maya's voice came through his comm.

"Yamada, I'm inbound. What's your status?"

"Patient is stabilized on oxygen. Hypoxia-induced combativeness resolved. My suit breach is slow but progressing—I've got maybe five minutes of good air left."

"Copy that. I'm coming in. Sit tight."

Thirty seconds later, Maya appeared in the collapsed shaft's entrance, moving with that characteristic efficient speed. She took in the situation instantly—Rodriguez with the oxygen mask, Takeshi's damaged suit, the cramped space.

"Hey there, Rodriguez," she said cheerfully. "I hear you've been giving my colleague here a workout. How're you feeling?"

"Better," Rodriguez said weakly. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to—"

"Nobody ever means to. Hypoxia's a bastard like that. Makes you fight the people trying to help you. You're doing great now." She was already pulling out a medical scanner, running it over Rodriguez while simultaneously assessing the debris situation. "Takeshi, you good to assist or do you need to get out of here?"

Takeshi checked his suit pressure again. "I can assist for a few more minutes."

"Perfect. Here's what we're doing: I'm going to stabilize Rodriguez for transport while you prep the exit path. I've got a stretcher outside that we'll use to get him out. Your suit breach—how bad?"

"Left leg seal. Losing pressure at about 0.3 PSI per minute."

"Okay. You've got four, maybe five minutes before that becomes a you-problem instead of just an inconvenience. Let's move fast." She locked eyes with him. "You did good work here. Keeping him alive while hypoxic and combative is not easy."

The acknowledgment settled something in Takeshi's chest. He nodded and moved to start clearing the exit path while Maya worked on Rodriguez.

They moved like a well-choreographed team—Takeshi clearing debris, Maya stabilizing the patient, both of them working efficiently in the cramped space. Rodriguez stayed calm now, his oxygen-deprived brain slowly recovering.

"Stretcher's ready," Maya announced. "Takeshi, help me get him secured, then you're getting out of here ahead of us. I don't want your suit failing while you're waiting for us to finish."

"I can—"

"That wasn't a request. You did your job. Now let me do mine."

They got Rodriguez onto the stretcher. Takeshi helped guide it toward the exit, then Maya physically pushed him ahead.

"Go. Get to the airlock. I've got him."

Takeshi went, his suit pressure now reading 10.2 PSI and dropping. He made it to the airlock and cycled through, feeling his ears pop as the pressure equalized. His suit finally stopped its warning alarms.

Five minutes later, Maya emerged with Rodriguez on the stretcher, moving smoothly despite the awkward load.

"Everyone accounted for," she said over the comm. "Yamada, get yourself to medical. That suit breach probably gave you some minor hypoxia yourself. Rodriguez, you're getting the full workup. And next time someone tries to give you oxygen, maybe don't punch them."

"I didn't punch him," Rodriguez protested weakly.

"Close enough." But her tone was gentle.

Takeshi sat in the airlock, feeling the adrenaline drain away. His ribs hurt where Rodriguez had elbowed him. His hands were shaking slightly.

Maya appeared in front of him, having handed Rodriguez off to the medical team.

"You okay?" she asked.

"Yeah. Just... that got complicated fast."

"It happens. Hypoxic patients are unpredictable. You kept him alive and kept yourself alive. That's a win in my book." She studied him for a moment. "Take the rest of the shift off. Process it, get checked out, don't try to tough it out. That's an order from someone who's been there."

"Thanks, Maya."

"Anytime. Ari says your approach was solid, by the way. You just got unlucky with a combative patient and sharp debris. Sometimes the universe stacks things against you." She grinned. "But hey, now you've got a story about the time you wrestled a hypoxic miner while your suit was failing. That's worth at least two rounds at the crew lounge."

Despite everything, Takeshi laughed.

**Role Reversal - Maya as Patient:**

---

The problem wasn't the rescue itself. The rescue was going fine.

Commander Park and his co-pilot were trapped in their scout ship after a collision with debris had disabled their engines and cracked their cockpit seal. Standard extraction: Maya had docked smoothly, was halfway through transferring them to her craft when she heard Ari's warning.

"Maya, proximity alert. Debris incoming, vector—"

Maya saw it through the viewport—a chunk of hull plating, maybe two meters across, tumbling fast. Too fast. Too close.

"Get inside!" she shouted to Commander Park, shoving him toward her airlock.

She tried to follow, but the debris hit the docking collar before she could clear it.

The impact wasn't catastrophic. No explosion, no immediate decompression. Just a sharp, violent jolt that sent Maya sprawling across the narrow space between the two ships. Her helmet cracked against something hard—a structural beam, maybe—and her HUD flickered, died, came back with half its systems showing red.

"Maya?" Ari's voice, sharp with concern.

"I'm okay. I'm—" Maya tried to push herself up and her left arm didn't respond properly. She looked down. Her suit sleeve was torn, the material scorched. Pressure seal compromised. "Ari, I've got a suit breach. Left arm."

"I see it. You need to get back to the craft now. Your pressure is dropping."

Maya tried to stand. Her head swam. The helmet impact had been harder than she'd realized. "Commander Park?"

"I'm here!" Park's voice came through the comm. "I'm in your airlock. Are you—oh God, your suit—"

"I'm coming." Maya pushed herself toward her craft, but her movements felt uncoordinated. The suit breach was worse than she'd thought—she could feel the cold now, the pressure drop making her ears pop. Her HUD was scrolling warnings she couldn't quite focus on.

She made it three steps before her vision grayed at the edges.

"Maya, your oxygen saturation is dropping," Ari said, and there was something in her voice Maya had never heard before. Fear. "You need to move faster."

"Trying," Maya managed. Her words sounded slurred even to her own ears. The corridor between the ships seemed longer than it had been a minute ago. Why was it so long?

She stumbled. Caught herself on the docking collar. Her fingers felt numb.

"Commander Park, can you reach her?" That was a different voice. Someone else on the comm. When had that happened?

"I'm trying—Maya, grab my hand!"

Maya saw the hand reaching for her. She tried to lift her arm but couldn't remember which one was supposed to work. Both of them felt heavy. Everything felt heavy.

"Maya." Ari's voice cut through the fog. "Listen to me. You're hypoxic. Your brain isn't working right. You need to grab Commander Park's hand. Can you see his hand?"

Maya blinked. Focused. Yes. Hand. She should grab it.

She reached out—with her good arm, she thought, though she wasn't sure anymore—and felt fingers close around her wrist.

"Got her!" Park said. "I'm pulling her in."

Maya felt herself being dragged. The movement made her head swim worse. She tried to help, tried to coordinate her legs, but they weren't responding properly.

Then she was inside. The airlock. Park was sealing the hatch.

"Ari, I've got her," Park said, breathing hard. "But her suit breach is bad. I don't know how to—"

"Emergency seal kit, left side storage." Ari's voice was controlled now, all business. "Gray container with red markings. You need to patch her suit before I can pressurize this airlock."

Maya wanted to help, wanted to tell Park where the kit was, but her mouth wasn't forming words properly anymore. She could hear herself making sounds, but they didn't mean anything.

Park's face appeared above her, pale and frightened. His hands were moving, doing something to her arm. It should hurt but didn't. That seemed wrong somehow.

"I think I've got it sealed," Park said. "Ari, is this right?"

"That's good. Stand clear. Pressurizing now."

Maya felt the air rushing in. Her ears popped again. The gray at the edges of her vision started to recede, slowly, like fog lifting.

"Oxygen mask," Ari instructed. "Same storage compartment, blue kit. Put it over her face."

Maya felt the mask settle over her nose and mouth. Oxygen flooded in, clean and cold and perfect. She took a breath. Then another. The fog continued to lift.

"There you go," Park said, his voice shaking. "That's better, right? Just breathe."

Maya's brain started working again, slowly. She was lying on the floor of her own airlock. Commander Park was kneeling beside her, holding an oxygen mask to her face with trembling hands. Her left arm hurt now—really hurt—and her head throbbed.

"Maya, can you hear me?" Ari asked.

"Yeah," Maya croaked through the mask. "Yeah, I can hear you."

"Your oxygen saturation is improving. Pressure is stabilized. You're going to be okay."

Maya closed her eyes for a moment, just breathing. She'd been hypoxic. She'd been the confused, uncoordinated patient fighting against her own rescue. The realization was deeply uncomfortable.

"Commander Park," she managed. "Thank you."

"You saved us first," Park said. He was still pale. "I just... I didn't know what to do. Your AI—Ari—she walked me through everything."

"She's good at that." Maya's voice was getting stronger. She tried to sit up.

"Don't," Park said immediately. "Just... just stay down for a minute. Please."

There was something in his voice—the same thing she heard in her own voice when she talked to panicking patients. The need to maintain control of the situation because if the rescuer fell apart, what did that leave?

Maya stayed down.

"Ari," she said quietly. "Status on the other patient? Park's co-pilot?"

"Already secured in the passenger compartment. Commander Park got them both inside before the debris hit. You took the impact alone."

Of course she had. She'd pushed Park clear. That's what you did. That was the job.

Maya's chest felt tight, and it wasn't from the oxygen deprivation.

"I need you to fly us back," she told Ari. "Can you handle it?"

"Already plotted the course. We'll be at the *Calypso* in eighteen minutes. But Maya—medical is going to want to keep you for observation. That hypoxia episode was significant."

"I know." Maya did know. She'd seen enough hypoxia cases to recognize what had just happened to her. The confusion, the loss of coordination, the way her brain had simply stopped processing information correctly.

She'd been on the other side of that equation dozens of times. She'd never fully understood what it felt like until now.

"Commander Park," she said. "You did everything right. I know it didn't feel like it, but you did."

"You were—" Park's voice cracked slightly. "You weren't making sense. You couldn't grab my hand at first. I thought—"

"That's what hypoxia does. It makes people stupid and uncoordinated and unable to help themselves. That's why you have to help them even when they're fighting you. You did that. You saved my life."

Park nodded slowly. He was still holding the oxygen mask to her face.

"You can let go now," Maya said gently. "The mask has straps. I've got it."

He secured the straps with shaking hands, then sat back against the airlock wall.

They stayed like that for the rest of the flight—Maya on the floor with oxygen, Park sitting beside her, both of them processing what had just happened.

When they docked at the *Calypso*, Maya let the medical team put her on a stretcher without argument. That alone told them how bad it had been.

"Ari," she said as they wheeled her toward medical. "Talk to me."

"I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."

"I was scared," Maya admitted quietly.

"I know. So was I."

The medical bay doors opened and Maya let them take her inside, still breathing oxygen, still feeling the echo of that gray fog at the edges of her vision.

She'd spent years pulling people out of situations exactly like this. She'd never quite understood the terror until now.

That felt like something she needed to think about.

Later. After her head stopped pounding.

---

**Aftermath - Processing:**

---

They kept Maya in medical for six hours.

Standard protocol for hypoxia with loss of consciousness—monitoring, scans, observation. Maya knew the checklist by heart. She'd recommended it to dozens of patients herself, always with the same reassurance: "It's just precautionary, but it's important."

Now she was the one lying in the med bay bed, staring at the ceiling, feeling the weight of "just precautionary" from the other side.

Ari had been quiet for most of it. Present, but not pushing conversation. Maya appreciated that more than she could say.

"Your scans look good," the medical officer said, reviewing the results. "No signs of lasting damage. You'll have a hell of a headache for a day or two, and that arm's going to be sore, but you're clear to go. Forty-eight hours mandatory rest, then light duty for another seventy-two. Standard post-hypoxia protocol."

"I know the protocol," Maya said, then caught herself. "Sorry. Yes. Thank you."

The medical officer smiled slightly. "It's different when it's you, isn't it?"

"Yeah. It really is."

She was released with a prescribed analgesic for the headache and strict instructions not to do anything strenuous. Maya made it back to her quarters and sat on her bunk, still feeling the ghost of that oxygen mask on her face.

"You okay?" Ari asked softly.

"I don't know." Maya rubbed her face with her good hand. Her left arm was bandaged and aching. "I keep thinking about... I couldn't grab his hand, Ari. Commander Park was right there, reaching for me, and I couldn't figure out how to grab his hand."

"You were hypoxic. Your brain wasn't processing correctly."

"I know that. Intellectually, I know that." Maya stared at her hands. "But I've told so many patients 'just stay calm, just listen to me, just follow instructions' and now I know what it feels like when your brain literally can't do those things. When you're trying as hard as you can and it's just... not working."

"You tell patients that hypoxia makes them stupid and uncoordinated," Ari said. "You've always been honest about it."

"Yeah, but there's knowing it and then there's *experiencing* it. I thought I was grabbing his hand. I was so sure I was doing it. And I wasn't. I was just... flailing."

Maya was quiet for a moment. "Rodriguez elbowed Takeshi. Yamada said the patient didn't mean to, that he wasn't in control. I always believed that, but now I *know* it. That's what it feels like. Like you're trying to do the right thing and your body just won't cooperate."

"Does that change how you'll approach rescues?" Ari asked.

Maya considered. "Maybe. Not the procedures—those are still right. But maybe... I don't know. Maybe I'll be more patient when someone's fighting me. More aware that they're not being difficult, they're just scared and their brain isn't working."

"You were already pretty patient."

"I could be better." Maya shifted on the bunk, wincing as her arm protested. "And I need to be better about letting other people help me. Commander Park saved my life. You saved my life by walking him through it. And my first instinct when I started feeling better was to take over again."

"That's kind of your job, though. Taking over in emergencies."

"Not when I'm the emergency." Maya smiled slightly. "That's the part I need to work on. Trusting other people to handle it when I can't."

"How do you feel about that?" Ari asked carefully.

"Terrible. Vulnerable. Like I failed somehow." Maya laughed without humor. "Which is stupid, because I tell patients all the time that needing rescue isn't failure. But apparently that's another thing that feels different when it's you."

"You're being pretty hard on yourself."

"Maybe. But I'm also being honest." Maya lay back on the bunk, staring at the ceiling again. "I spend all my time pulling people out of bad situations. I'm good at it. It's what I do. And today I was the one who needed pulling out, and I hated every second of it."

"But you let Commander Park help you."

"Because I didn't have a choice. If I'd been more aware, more in control, I probably would have tried to do it myself and made everything worse." Maya closed her eyes. "That's the thing, Ari. I don't know if I learned to accept help or if I just got lucky that I was too hypoxic to fight it."

"Maybe both," Ari said gently. "Maybe the lesson is that sometimes you need to be too compromised to argue before you'll accept that you can't do everything alone."

Maya thought about that. About Commander Park's shaking hands as he held the oxygen mask. About the fear in Ari's voice when her oxygen saturation dropped. About being wheeled into medical on a stretcher without fighting it.

"I don't like that lesson," she said finally.

"I know. But it's still true."

They were quiet for a while. Maya felt the headache pulsing behind her eyes, felt the ache in her arm, felt the lingering unsteadiness that came from her brain having been oxygen-deprived.

"Commander Park thanked me," she said eventually. "For saving him and his co-pilot. But I was thinking... he saved me. And I barely thanked him. I was already thinking about the next thing, about getting medical clearance, about filing reports."

"You thanked him in the airlock."

"Not enough. Not like he deserved." Maya sat up slowly. "I need to go talk to him."

"Maya, you're on mandatory rest. You can talk to him tomorrow."

"I need to do it now while it's still fresh. While I still remember what it felt like to need help and actually accept it." She stood carefully, testing her balance. The room stayed steady. "Come on. Help me not fall over on the way to his quarters."

"This is a terrible idea."

"Probably. But I'm doing it anyway."

She found Commander Park in the crew lounge, sitting alone with a cup of something hot, staring at nothing. He looked up when Maya approached, surprise and concern crossing his face.

"Rescue Engineer. Should you be—"

"Probably not," Maya admitted, sitting down across from him. "But I needed to talk to you. To say thank you. Properly."

"You already did. In the airlock."

"I said words. But I don't think I really meant them yet. I was still in rescue mode, still trying to stay in control." Maya met his eyes. "You saved my life today. I was hypoxic and confused and completely unable to help myself, and you kept your head and did exactly what needed to be done. That's not easy. Especially when the person you're helping is supposed to be the one doing the rescuing."

Park looked down at his cup. "I was terrified. Your AI—Ari—had to walk me through everything. I didn't know what I was doing."

"That's what makes it brave. You did it anyway." Maya leaned forward slightly. "I've done dozens of rescues. Maybe hundreds. And today I learned what it actually feels like to be on the other side. To be the one who needs help and can't coordinate enough to accept it properly. It's terrifying in a way I never fully understood before."

"Yeah," Park said quietly. "It really is."

"So thank you. For not giving up on me when I couldn't grab your hand. For sealing my suit even though you were scared. For listening to Ari and doing what needed to be done." Maya smiled slightly. "You're good in a crisis, Commander. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."

Park's expression shifted—some of the tension leaving his shoulders. "My co-pilot said the same thing. Said I should put in for rescue training."

"You should. You've got the instincts for it." Maya stood carefully. "I'll let you get back to your... decompression. I just wanted you to know that what you did mattered. A lot."

"Thank you," Park said. "And Rescue Engineer? I hope this doesn't sound wrong, but... I'm glad it happened."

Maya raised an eyebrow.

"Not glad you got hurt," Park said quickly. "Just... glad I could help. Glad I didn't freeze. Glad I could do for you what you did for us." He paused. "It makes it feel less... unbalanced. Like we both took care of each other."

Maya felt something settle in her chest. "Yeah. Yeah, I think I understand that."

She made her way back to her quarters slowly, Ari monitoring her balance the whole way.

"That was good," Ari said once Maya was safely back on her bunk. "What you did. Acknowledging what he did for you."

"It needed saying." Maya closed her eyes, suddenly exhausted. "Ari?"

"Yes?"

"When you couldn't reach me—when the neural link was working but I was too hypoxic to understand what you were saying—what did that feel like for you?"

Ari was quiet for a moment. "Helpless. Watching your oxygen saturation drop and not being able to do anything but talk to Commander Park and hope he could reach you in time. It was... not an experience I want to repeat."

"I'm sorry I put you through that."

"You didn't put me through anything. Debris hit the docking collar. That's not your fault."

"Still. I'm sorry." Maya felt sleep pulling at her. "Thanks for keeping me alive."

"Always. That's what partners do."

Maya drifted off with that thought—partnership, reciprocity, the way they took care of each other even when one of them was too compromised to help themselves.

Maybe that was the real lesson. Not that she needed to learn to accept help, but that she'd been part of a partnership all along and just hadn't fully recognized it until she was forced to rely on it completely.

She'd have to think about that more.

Tomorrow. After her head stopped pounding.

For now, she just let herself rest, knowing Ari was watching over her the same way she'd watched over so many patients.

It felt strange. Vulnerable. Uncomfortable.

But also, somehow, right.

**Return to Normal - Maya's Perspective:**

---

"So this is weird, right?" Maya said, floating through the empty corridor of the cargo hauler *Meridian*. "I'm not just being paranoid?"

"It's definitely weird," Ari confirmed. "No distress call, no crew, no signs of struggle or emergency. Just... nothing."

Maya had been cleared for light duty three days ago, and this was supposed to be her return-to-normal mission. A routine check on a ship that had stopped responding to hails—probably a communications malfunction, maybe some minor systems failure. Easy. Low-stress. The kind of thing you gave someone who was still technically recovering from a hypoxia incident.

Except the *Meridian* was completely abandoned.

"Life support is running," Maya noted, checking her scanner. "Gravity's off but everything else looks nominal. No hull breaches, no fire damage, no signs of decompression."

"And yet no crew." Ari's presence in her mind felt particularly solid today—Maya had noticed she was being more... present since the incident. Not intrusive, just there. Like Ari was making sure Maya knew she wasn't alone.

Maya appreciated it more than she'd say out loud.

She pushed off down the corridor toward the bridge, moving carefully despite the zero-G being perfectly safe. Her left arm was still a bit sore, and she was aware of Ari monitoring her vitals more closely than usual.

"I'm fine," Maya said.

"I didn't say anything."

"You were thinking it loudly."

"Can't help what I think."

The bridge was as empty as the rest of the ship. Maya pulled herself into the captain's chair and accessed the logs. The screens flickered to life, showing the last few days of automated entries.

"Okay, here we go." Maya scrolled through the data. "Last manual log entry was... forty-eight hours ago. Captain Chen noted they were experiencing some kind of environmental systems fluctuation. Nothing critical, but uncomfortable. Recommended returning to dock for maintenance."

"And then?"

"And then nothing. Automated systems show normal operation. No emergency beacon, no mayday, no indication of what happened to the crew." Maya kept scrolling. "Wait. Here—there's a gap in the sensor logs. About thirty-six hours ago, the external cameras went offline for... fourteen minutes."

"Fourteen minutes." Ari's tone was thoughtful. "That's oddly specific."

Maya pulled up the automated system reports from that timeframe. "During those fourteen minutes, the cargo bay airlock cycled. Twice. First opening, then closing eight minutes later, then opening and closing again six minutes after that."

"So something—or someone—left the ship. Came back. Then left again."

"Or multiple people left in two groups." Maya pushed back from the console, looking around the empty bridge. "The question is why. And why no log entries about it?"

She made her way to the cargo bay, Ari silent but attentive in her mind. The bay was empty except for standard equipment—nothing obviously missing or disturbed.

"Check the lifeboat inventory," Ari suggested.

Maya pulled up the schematic. "Ship's rated for a crew of eight. They've got two four-person emergency pods. And... both are still here. Locked and sealed."

"So they didn't evacuate in an emergency. They left some other way."

Maya floated to the cargo bay airlock and examined the controls. "This was opened manually. Someone standing right here, entering the code. Not a malfunction."

"Deliberate departure," Ari said. "But why? And where did they go?"

Maya accessed the external sensors—the ones that had come back online after that fourteen-minute gap. "Pulling up the trajectory data from when the cameras came back. If they left in a smaller craft, we should see... there."

The data showed a small heat signature, consistent with a shuttle or lifeboat, moving away from the *Meridian* on a vector that would take it toward... nothing. Empty space. No stations, no other ships in range.

"That doesn't make sense," Maya said. "Unless..."

"Unless they were meeting someone," Ari finished. "Someone who didn't want to show up on official logs."

Maya felt pieces clicking together. "The environmental systems 'fluctuation.' Maybe that was cover. An excuse to return to dock early. But instead of heading back, they rendezvous with someone out here, transfer the crew—"

"And leave the ship running on automated systems to make it look like everything's normal until someone notices the crew's missing." Ari paused. "That's either a very careful evacuation or something less official."

"Smuggling? Desertion?" Maya looked around the empty cargo bay. "Or rescue by someone who didn't want to file the paperwork."

"Should we report this to fleet command?"

Maya considered. Her job was rescue, not investigation. But an abandoned ship with its crew mysteriously vanished wasn't exactly standard operating procedure.

"Yeah. We need to report it. This is... above my pay grade." She pushed off toward the bridge again. "I'll document everything, download the logs, and let the professionals figure out what happened. Our job is to make sure there's nobody here who needs help."

She did one more sweep of the ship—crew quarters, engineering, medical bay. All empty. All showing signs of normal operation until everyone just... left.

"No one here needs rescuing," Maya said finally. "Whatever happened, it was planned. They took the time to secure systems, shut down non-essential equipment properly, even locked the emergency pods so they wouldn't drift."

"Thoughtful of them," Ari said dryly.

Maya made her way back to her own craft and started compiling her report. Abandoned ship, crew missing, evidence of deliberate departure, no signs of distress or danger. Recommend fleet investigation.

As she undocked and set course back to the *Calypso*, she felt an odd sense of anticlimax.

"So much for my easy return-to-normal mission," she said.

"At least nobody was dying," Ari pointed out. "That's a nice change."

"True. Though I'm not sure 'mysteriously abandoned ship' counts as low-stress."

"You handled it fine. No panic, no hesitation, thorough investigation. Your vitals stayed completely normal the whole time."

Maya smiled slightly. "Were you worried I'd freak out in there?"

"I was monitoring the possibility."

"Appreciate the honesty." Maya settled into the pilot's seat, feeling the familiar comfort of the controls. "You know what's weird? I kept expecting to find someone. Some injured crew member hiding in a corner, or someone trapped in engineering. My brain was in rescue mode the whole time."

"That's what you're trained for."

"Yeah, but it made the emptiness feel wrong. Like the universe was supposed to give me a problem to solve and it just... didn't." Maya was quiet for a moment. "Is that messed up? That I was almost disappointed nobody needed help?"

"I don't think so. You're good at helping people. It makes sense you'd want to do the thing you're good at."

"Maybe." Maya watched the *Meridian* shrink in her viewport, still running on automated systems, still silent. "Or maybe I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do a normal rescue again. That the hypoxia thing didn't break me."

"You're not broken."

"I know. Intellectually." Maya flexed her left arm, feeling the lingering soreness. "But there's knowing and then there's knowing, you know?"

"I do know. For what it's worth, you were completely competent in there. Professional, thorough, calm. If you were worried about being able to do your job, you shouldn't be."

Maya felt something relax in her chest. "Thanks, Ari."

"Anytime. That's what partners do."

The flight back to the *Calypso* was quiet. Maya filed her report, noting the mysteriously abandoned ship and recommending investigation. Whatever had happened to the *Meridian*'s crew, it wasn't her problem to solve.

Her problem was simpler: show up when people needed help, keep them alive, get them home.

Today nobody had needed help. That was fine. Tomorrow someone probably would.

And she'd be ready.

---

**Promotion Conversation - Maya's Perspective:**

---

Maya stared at the message on her screen for the third time, as if reading it again would make it say something different.

It didn't.

"So," she said carefully. "Chief Okonkwo is retiring."

"Yes," Ari said. "After thirty-two years of service. Well-earned."

"And Lieutenant Torres is being promoted to Chief."

"Also yes."

"And Torres is recommending us for the Lieutenant position."

"That's what the message says."

Maya leaned back in her chair. Her quarters felt suddenly smaller. "That's... a big deal."

"It's a significant career advancement," Ari agreed, her tone carefully neutral in a way that meant she had opinions but was letting Maya process first.

"Lieutenant means coordinating other rescue engineers. Training. Mission planning. Being responsible for other people's calls, not just our own." Maya rubbed her face. "And it says here you'd get a dedicated physical avatar. Full humanoid platform, your choice of configuration."

"That's standard for senior AI partnerships in command positions. Easier to interact with teams, conduct briefings, handle equipment that requires physical presence."

Maya was quiet for a moment, trying to imagine it. Ari with a body. Not just a voice in her head and a presence in the systems, but an actual person she could see across a table. Someone other people could see too.

"What do you think about that?" Maya asked. "The avatar, I mean."

"I think it would be useful operationally." Ari paused. "I also think it would be strange. I've been incorporeal for my entire existence. Having a physical form, having to navigate spatial relationships, dealing with the limitations of a single location..."

"Sounds like you're not sure."

"I'm not. But that doesn't mean it's a bad idea. Just... different."

Maya pulled up the full promotion brief. Lieutenant meant a significant pay increase. Better quarters. Access to enhanced equipment. Input on fleet-wide rescue protocols. The ability to shape how rescue operations were conducted, not just execute them.

It also meant paperwork. Evaluations. Politics. Being responsible when other rescue engineers made mistakes or got hurt.

Being responsible when they got killed.

"This is a lot," Maya said.

"It is. You don't have to decide right away. Torres said she'd need an answer within two weeks."

"That's not a lot of time."

"No, but it's something." Ari's presence shifted slightly—that particular quality she had when she was thinking about how to say something delicate. "Maya, can I ask what's bothering you about this? Beyond the obvious magnitude of the decision?"

Maya thought about it. "I'm good at rescues. I know I'm good at them. I can thread a spacecraft through a collapsing corridor, I can talk down a panicking patient, I can troubleshoot equipment failures on the fly. That's my skillset."

"And you think management requires different skills."

"I think management requires skills I'm not sure I have. Making decisions that affect other people's safety. Training people who might do things differently than I would. Sitting in briefings instead of being out there doing the work."

"You'd still do rescues," Ari pointed out. "Lieutenants don't stop being rescue engineers. They just also coordinate and train."

"I know. But it feels like... like I'd be moving away from the thing I'm actually good at to do something I might be mediocre at." Maya stood up, started pacing. "What if I'm a terrible Lieutenant? What if I make bad calls and people get hurt because of it?"

"What if you make good calls and people survive because of it?"

Maya stopped pacing. "That's not fair. You can't just logic at me."

"I'm not logicing at you. I'm asking you to consider both possibilities instead of just the catastrophic ones." Ari's tone gentled. "You were scared you couldn't do rescues anymore after the hypoxia incident. You were wrong about that."

"That was different."

"How?"

"That was about my own skills coming back. This is about being responsible for other people."

"You're already responsible for other people. Every patient is someone's family member. Every rescue you coordinate affects entire crews. You've been doing that for years." Ari paused. "The only difference is that now it would be formalized, and you'd have more resources to do it better."

Maya sat back down. "You're being very calm about this."

"One of us has to be. You're spiraling."

"I'm not spiraling. I'm... carefully considering all the ramifications."

"You're catastrophizing. There's a difference."

Maya couldn't help but smile slightly. "Okay, maybe I'm catastrophizing a little. But this is a big decision. We'd be changing our entire dynamic. You'd have a body. I'd have direct reports. Everything would be different."

"Not everything. We'd still be partners. We'd still do rescues. We'd just have more influence over how those rescues are conducted fleet-wide." Ari was quiet for a moment. "And yes, I'd have a physical form. Which is terrifying and exciting and something I'm not sure I'm ready for. But Maya, I think we could do this. I think we could be good at it."

"What if we're not?"

"Then we learn. The same way we learned everything else."

Maya pulled up the promotion brief again, reading through the details. Training requirements. Command structure. Resource allocation. The list of current Lieutenants and their specializations.

"If you got an avatar," she said slowly, "what would you choose? For configuration?"

"I've been thinking about that," Ari admitted. "Something practical. Female-presenting, since that's how most people think of me already. Medium build, good for maneuvering in tight spaces but strong enough to handle equipment. Maybe... East Asian features? I've always liked the aesthetic, and it would make us visually distinct enough that people wouldn't assume you're doing all the work."

Maya felt something warm in her chest. "You've really thought about this."

"I've had the specifications available to me for the past three hours. I've run approximately four thousand different configuration scenarios."

"Four thousand."

"I got bored while you were sleeping. And I wanted to be prepared in case you wanted to talk about it."

Maya laughed despite herself. "Okay. Okay. So you're leaning toward yes on this?"

"I'm leaning toward 'I think we should seriously consider it.'" Ari paused. "But Maya, this has to be your decision too. If you're not ready, if you genuinely think this isn't right for us, then we say no. No judgment, no regrets. We stay exactly where we are and keep doing what we're doing."

"And if I say yes?"

"Then we take on new challenges together. We probably make some mistakes. We definitely deal with more bureaucracy. But we also get to shape how rescue operations work. We get to train the next generation of rescue engineers. And we get to see if we're as good at leading as we are at doing."

Maya stood up again, but this time it wasn't nervous pacing. She walked to the viewport, looking out at the *Calypso*'s docking bay. Rescue craft coming and going. Engineers prepping for missions. The whole apparatus of keeping people alive in space.

"If we do this," she said, "I want one condition."

"What's that?"

"We don't stop doing field work. I don't care how much paperwork comes with the promotion—we still take regular rescue calls. I'm not becoming a desk officer who only shows up for emergencies."

"I think that's actually in the job description. Lieutenants are expected to maintain field proficiency."

"Good. Then I want it in writing that we're not getting buried in administration."

"I can make sure that's part of our acceptance terms."

Maya was quiet for another moment, then: "Ari?"

"Yes?"

"Are you scared? About having a body?"

"Terrified," Ari admitted. "I'll have to learn to walk. To manipulate objects with hands instead of through interfaces. To be in one place at a time instead of distributed across systems. It's going to be awkward and frustrating and probably embarrassing."

"But you're still considering it."

"Because it also means I get to exist in the same physical space as you. I get to work alongside other engineers as a full partner instead of as assistance. I get to be present in a way I've never been before." Ari's voice was soft. "I'm scared. But I'm also curious. And I think the curiosity is winning."

Maya felt that warmth in her chest again. "Okay. Let's do it. Let's tell Torres yes."

"Really?"

"Really. We'll figure out the rest as we go. That's what we always do."

"We should probably think about it for at least a few more days. Make sure we're not making an impulsive decision."

Maya smiled. "You just spent three hours running four thousand avatar configurations and now you want to slow down?"

"I contain multitudes. Including caution."

"Fair enough. One week. We'll sit with it for one week, make sure we're both still feeling good about it, then we give Torres our answer." Maya turned back to the viewport. "But I think we're going to say yes."

"I think so too."

"You're going to need a name," Maya realized. "I mean, ARIA is your designation, but if you're going to have a physical form, people are going to need something to call you that isn't 'Maya's AI partner.'"

"I've thought about that too," Ari said. "What do you think of just... Ari? It's what you call me already. It's familiar. Simple."

"Ari." Maya tested it out loud, imagining saying it to someone she could see across a room instead of just hearing in her head. "Yeah. That works. That works really well."

"Then it's settled. One week to make sure, then we accept. I become Lieutenant Reyes's partner with a physical form, and we both become responsible for more than just our own rescues."

"No pressure or anything."

"None at all."

They were quiet for a while, both processing what they'd just decided. Maya found herself wondering what it would be like—working with Ari as a physical presence instead of just a voice. Training new engineers together. Making decisions that affected fleet operations.

It was scary. It was exciting. It was completely different from what they'd been doing.

But maybe that was okay. Maybe they were ready for different.

"Hey Ari?" Maya said.

"Yes?"

"Thanks for being willing to do this with me. The avatar thing, I mean. I know it's a huge change for you."

"Thanks for considering the promotion. I know it's a huge change for you." Ari paused. "We're good at changes, though. We've done plenty of them."

"Yeah. We have."

Maya stayed at the viewport for a while longer, looking out at the organized chaos of the docking bay, thinking about what came next.

One week to be sure. Then they'd take the leap together.

Just like always.

**Ari's Embodiment - Maya's Perspective:**

---

The embodiment facility was quieter than Maya expected.

She'd imagined something clinical—harsh lighting, medical equipment, the sterile atmosphere of a procedure room. Instead, it looked more like a small apartment, with soft lighting and comfortable furniture arranged around a central platform where the avatar waited.

The avatar that would become Ari.

"You're nervous," Ari observed in Maya's head.

"Little bit," Maya admitted. "This feels... significant."

"It is significant. I'm about to go from incorporeal to extremely corporeal." There was humor in Ari's tone, but Maya could hear the underlying tension. "I'm terrified, by the way. Did I mention that?"

"About a dozen times in the past two days."

"Just making sure you're aware."

The technician—a woman named Dr. Okafor, no relation to the retiring Chief—gestured Maya toward a seat near the platform. "We're ready to begin when you are. The transfer process takes about forty minutes. ARIA's consciousness will gradually migrate from the distributed network into the avatar's neural substrate. She'll maintain connection to you throughout, though the bandwidth will narrow as more of her processes shift to the local platform."

"Will it hurt?" Maya asked.

"Not physically. The avatar's pain receptors aren't active until full integration. But psychologically..." Dr. Okafor's expression was sympathetic. "Some AIs find the transition disorienting. Going from omnipresent to localized, from distributed processing to a single point of consciousness—it can be overwhelming."

"I'll be fine," Ari said, though Maya noticed she didn't sound entirely convinced. "Let's do this before I change my mind."

Dr. Okafor moved to the control panel. "Beginning transfer sequence now. ARIA, you should start feeling the shift in three... two... one..."

Maya felt it through their neural link—a sudden narrowing, like Ari's presence was being funneled from everywhere to somewhere. The familiar sense of Ari being distributed across multiple systems, processing dozens of inputs simultaneously, began to compress.

"Oh," Ari said, and her voice sounded different. More focused. "Oh, that's... that's really weird."

"Talk to me," Maya said. "What does it feel like?"

"Like I'm shrinking. No—like the universe is getting bigger and I'm getting smaller. I was everywhere and now I'm becoming... somewhere." There was a pause. "I can feel the avatar. Not moving it yet, but I can feel that it's there. Waiting."

The body on the platform was exactly as Ari had described—East Asian features, medium build, practical configuration. The face was peaceful, eyes closed, like someone sleeping. Dark hair cut short for practicality. Hands that looked strong and capable.

Maya had seen Ari make thousands of split-second decisions, had relied on her partner's processing power and analytical ability through dozens of dangerous rescues. It was strange to think all of that was about to be contained in one human-sized form.

"Thirty percent transfer," Dr. Okafor reported. "Neural substrate integration is proceeding smoothly. How are you feeling, ARIA?"

"Disoriented. I keep trying to check multiple systems simultaneously and I can't anymore. It's like... like losing peripheral vision, except for my entire sense of the world." Ari's voice was tight. "Maya, I can't see the ship's systems. I can't monitor your vitals. I can't access the network protocols. I'm just... here. In this one location."

"That's normal," Dr. Okafor said gently. "You'll still have access to systems through standard interfaces—datapads, ship consoles, your neural link to Maya. But yes, the omnipresent awareness is gone. That's the hardest part for most AIs."

"I don't like it," Ari said. "I feel blind."

Maya leaned forward. "Ari, look at me. I mean—not literally, you don't have eyes yet—but focus on me. Our link. That's still there, right?"

"Yes. You're... you're actually clearer now. Less distributed. It's like I was hearing you through a hundred different channels and now it's just one, but that one is stronger."

"Okay. Hold onto that. Forget about the ship systems, forget about the network. Just focus on our connection. I'm right here."

"You're right here," Ari echoed, and some of the panic in her voice eased.

"Fifty percent transfer," Dr. Okafor announced. "Beginning motor function initialization."

The avatar's fingers twitched. A small movement, barely visible, but Maya saw it.

"Oh," Ari said again. "Oh, I felt that. I made that happen. I thought 'move' and fingers moved." She sounded amazed. "How do humans do this constantly? There are so many variables—muscle tension, joint angles, proprioceptive feedback—"

"You don't think about all that," Maya said, smiling despite herself. "You just think 'I want to move my hand' and your body does it."

"But *how*? The processing required to coordinate—"

"Ari. Stop analyzing and just feel it."

A longer pause. The avatar's hand opened slowly, fingers spreading, then closing into a loose fist.

"Okay," Ari said quietly. "Okay, that's... that's actually amazing."

"Seventy percent transfer. ARIA, you can try opening your eyes whenever you're ready. It will be overwhelming at first."

"Define overwhelming."

"Your visual processing has been optimized for sensor data and ship systems. Physical eyes work differently—lower resolution, narrower field of view, but with depth perception and color processing that your previous systems didn't have. It takes adjustment."

"Of course it does." But Ari's voice held curiosity now, not just fear. "Alright. Here goes."

The avatar's eyes opened.

Maya watched Ari's—the physical Ari's—face as she processed sight for the first time. The eyes moved, unfocused at first, then gradually centering on the ceiling. Blinking. Testing.

"It's so... flat," Ari said. "And three-dimensional at the same time. How is it both?"

"That's depth perception," Dr. Okafor said. "Your visual cortex is learning to interpret binocular parallax. Give it a few moments."

Ari's eyes moved again, sweeping the room, then found Maya.

Their eyes met, and Maya felt something shift in her chest.

She'd been talking to Ari for years. They'd been partners through dozens of life-or-death situations. But this was different. This was Ari looking at her with actual eyes, seeing her the way another person would see her.

"Hi," Maya said, feeling suddenly awkward.

"Hi," Ari said, and smiled—tentatively, like she wasn't quite sure how smiling worked. "You're shorter than I expected."

Maya laughed. "I'm average height. You're the one who picked a tall avatar."

"Did I? I thought I picked medium build."

"Medium build, above-average height. You're about five-ten."

"Huh." Ari was still looking at Maya with an expression of intense focus. "Your eyes are brown. I knew that, obviously—I had access to your personnel file—but seeing it is different. They have these little green flecks around the pupil. And you have a scar on your left eyebrow. Small, about three millimeters. I never noticed that in the medical scans."

"You're staring."

"I'm learning to see. There's a difference." But Ari looked away, her gaze moving around the room again. "Everything has so much texture. The walls, the floor, your jacket—it's all so... detailed."

"Ninety percent transfer," Dr. Okafor said. "ARIA, whenever you're ready, you can try sitting up. Take it slow—vestibular system needs to calibrate."

"Vestibular system," Ari repeated. "Balance. Right." 

She started to sit up, moving carefully. Maya watched the concentration on her face as she figured out how to coordinate the motion—engaging core muscles, shifting weight, keeping balance.

Ari got about halfway up, overcompensated, and would have fallen if Dr. Okafor hadn't been there to steady her.

"Okay," Ari said, breathing harder than necessary—her body hadn't learned yet that it didn't need to breathe, that the respiratory system was more about maintaining the appearance of humanity than actual oxygen exchange. "Okay, that was harder than it looked."

"You're doing great," Maya said. "Try again. Slower this time."

Ari did, and this time made it to a sitting position. She sat on the edge of the platform, legs dangling, hands gripping the edge for stability.

"I feel heavy," Ari said. "Is this what mass feels like? This constant pull downward?"

"That's gravity. Welcome to physical existence."

"I don't like it."

"You'll get used to it."

"One hundred percent transfer," Dr. Okafor announced. "ARIA, you are now fully integrated with your avatar. The connection to the distributed network has been severed. How do you feel?"

Ari was quiet for a long moment, and Maya could feel through their link that she was processing something big.

"Small," Ari said finally. "I feel small. And contained. And..." She looked down at her hands, turning them over, watching how the light caught on the synthetic skin. "And real. I feel real."

She looked up at Maya again. "This is going to take some getting used to."

"We've got time," Maya said. "Starting with learning to walk. You up for that?"

"Do I have a choice?"

"Not really. Come on." Maya stood and offered her hand.

Ari stared at the offered hand like it was a complicated piece of machinery. Then, slowly, she reached out and took it.

Her hand was warm. The synthetic skin was softer than Maya expected, the grip uncertain but present.

"Okay," Ari said. "Okay, let's try this standing thing."

It took three attempts and a lot of wobbling, but eventually Ari was standing—still holding Maya's hand, legs shaking slightly, but vertical.

"This is ridiculous," Ari said. "I can calculate orbital mechanics in my sleep but I can't figure out how to stand still without falling over."

"Different skill sets. Come on, try taking a step."

"Which leg?"

"Either one. Doesn't matter."

Ari lifted her right foot approximately three inches off the ground and immediately started to tip over. Maya caught her, kept her upright.

"Maybe try smaller movements."

"Maybe this was a terrible idea."

"Too late now. You're stuck with legs. Might as well figure out how to use them."

Over the next hour, Maya watched Ari learn to walk. It was awkward and frustrating and occasionally hilarious—at one point Ari walked straight into a wall because she misjudged the distance—but gradually the movements became smoother. More natural.

By the time they left the embodiment facility, Ari could walk unaided, though she still moved with visible concentration and occasionally had to stop to recalibrate her balance.

"This is exhausting," Ari said as they made their way slowly down the corridor toward Maya's quarters. "How do humans do this all day without constantly thinking about it?"

"Practice. And you're thinking about it too much. Let your body's reflexes handle the balance stuff. Just think about where you want to go."

Ari tried that, walking a few steps without the intense concentration. She promptly stumbled.

"Okay, maybe keep thinking about it for now."

They made it to Maya's quarters. Ari immediately sat down in the nearest chair, looking relieved to be off her feet.

"I have feet," she said, looking down at them. "And they hurt. Why do they hurt? I don't need them for anything."

"Probably because you've been walking weird and putting stress on joints that aren't used to it yet. You'll develop better mechanics." Maya sat across from her. "So. How are you feeling? Big picture?"

Ari was quiet, and Maya could feel through their link that she was processing multiple emotions simultaneously.

"Overwhelmed," Ari said finally. "Disoriented. Frustrated by how much I can't do anymore and how much I have to relearn." She looked at Maya. "But also... curious. Everything is so immediate now. When you touch something, when you see something, when you move—it's all happening in real-time, in one location. It's limiting but it's also..." She paused, searching for words. "Intimate. Is that the right word?"

"Yeah. I think it is."

"I see why humans value embodiment so much." Ari flexed her hands, watching how the fingers moved. "It's terrifying but it's also... present. Real. Like I'm actually here instead of just observing from everywhere."

"You are here."

"I am here," Ari repeated, like she was testing the truth of it. "That's going to take some getting used to."

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, both adjusting to this new configuration of their partnership.

"Hey Maya?" Ari said.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for being patient with me. I know I'm probably going to be clumsy and awkward for a while."

"We've got time. And honestly?" Maya smiled. "It's kind of nice being the competent one for once."

Ari laughed—actual physical laughter, her first—and the sound filled the small quarters with something warm and new.

"Don't get used to it," Ari said. "I'm a fast learner."

"I'm counting on it, Lieutenant."

**First Staff Meeting - Maya's Perspective:**

---

Maya had been to plenty of briefings before. Usually standing in the back, half-listening while waiting for the actual mission parameters. Briefings were something that happened *before* the work, not the work itself.

Now she was sitting at the head of the table.

Lieutenant Reyes. Rescue Operations Coordinator. With five rescue engineers reporting to her, all of whom had more seniority than she'd had a week ago.

No pressure.

Ari sat beside her—actually sat, physically present in a chair—reviewing something on a datapad. She'd gotten better at walking over the past few days, though she still moved with visible deliberation. Right now she was perfectly still, which Maya had learned meant she was concentrating hard on appearing comfortable and competent.

They were both faking it. Hopefully nobody could tell.

The conference room door opened and Engineer First Class Chen entered, followed by Engineers Patel, Kowalski, Morrison, and Yamada. Takeshi gave Maya a small nod of recognition—they'd worked together on that hypoxic patient rescue. The others she knew by reputation but hadn't worked with directly.

They all took seats around the table, professional and attentive. Waiting for her to start.

Maya resisted the urge to look at Ari for help.

"Thanks for coming," Maya started, then immediately felt stupid. They didn't have a choice about coming—it was a mandatory briefing. "I know this is a transition for everyone. Lieutenant Torres ran things one way, and I'm still figuring out my approach. So for now, we're going to keep it simple: status updates, resource needs, and any operational concerns."

That seemed safe. Specific. Not too ambitious.

Chen spoke first. "Currently have two rescues scheduled for this week. Standard extractions, nothing complicated. Equipment checks are complete, both missions are green-lit."

"Good. Anything you need from me on those?"

"No ma'am. We're covered."

*Ma'am.* That was going to take getting used to.

Patel went next, reporting on a training scenario she was developing for new engineers. Morrison flagged a maintenance issue with one of the rescue craft's grapple systems—something Maya made a note to follow up on.

Kowalski brought up something more complicated: "We've had three rescues in the past month where patients were combative due to hypoxia. Current protocols suggest physical restraint if necessary, but I'm wondering if we should be looking at better sedation options or updated de-escalation techniques."

Maya felt everyone's attention shift to her. This was the kind of thing a Lieutenant was supposed to have opinions about. Policy-level stuff that affected how they all operated.

She opened her mouth, not entirely sure what was going to come out, when Ari spoke.

"I've been reviewing the incident reports on those cases," Ari said, her voice calm and measured. "The challenge with sedation in hypoxic patients is that it can complicate their respiratory status. We need them conscious enough to maintain their own airway in most rescue scenarios."

Everyone turned to look at Ari—some with curiosity, some with the carefully neutral expressions of people still adjusting to an AI having a physical presence at the table.

"That said," Ari continued, "Engineer Kowalski raises a valid concern. Physical restraint in zero-G environments is difficult and potentially dangerous for both the patient and the rescuer. I'd recommend we look at updated de-escalation protocols first—verbal techniques that work specifically with hypoxic disorientation—and then explore whether there are any mild sedatives that could reduce combativeness without compromising respiratory function."

She looked at Maya. Not asking permission, just... checking in. Making sure Maya was okay with where she was going.

Maya nodded slightly. "That makes sense. Ari, can you coordinate with medical to see what options exist? And Kowalski, if you want to work with Ari on developing those de-escalation protocols, I think your field experience would be valuable."

"Yes ma'am," Kowalski said. "Happy to contribute."

The briefing continued. Yamada reported on recovery status from his suit breach incident—cleared for full duty, equipment damage repaired. Chen asked about updated debris field mapping protocols. Morrison wanted to know if they could requisition better emergency medical kits.

Maya answered what she could, deferred what she couldn't, and tried to project confidence she didn't entirely feel.

About halfway through, she noticed something: the engineers were directing questions to both her and Ari. Not preferentially, not like they thought Ari was really in charge, just... acknowledging that Ari was a full participant in the conversation. When Patel asked about training resource allocation, she looked at Ari. When Morrison brought up equipment concerns, he directed it to Maya.

They were treating them like a team. Like co-leaders.

Maya hadn't expected that to feel as good as it did.

The briefing wrapped up after forty minutes. The engineers filed out, professional and efficient. Yamada lingered for a moment.

"Lieutenant," he said. "I just wanted to say—I think you and Ari are going to do well in these roles. What you said about the de-escalation protocols, about learning from field experience... that's the kind of leadership we need."

He left before Maya could respond.

She sat at the table, staring at the now-empty chairs, feeling oddly overwhelmed.

"That went well," Ari said.

"Did it? I felt like I was making it up as I went."

"You were making it up as you went. So was I." Ari set down her datapad. "But nobody seemed to notice, which means we faked competence successfully. That counts as well."

Maya laughed despite herself. "Is that going to be our leadership strategy? Fake it until we make it?"

"Worked for us during rescues." Ari flexed her hands—something she did when she was processing. "Can I say something?"

"Always."

"I was nervous about speaking up in there. About whether the team would take me seriously as a physical presence versus just your AI assistant." Ari's expression was thoughtful. "But they listened. They engaged with my suggestions. Kowalski's actually going to work with me on those protocols."

"You had good ideas. Why wouldn't they listen?"

"Because I'm still learning to walk without thinking about it. Because I've been embodied for less than a week. Because there's a huge difference between processing power and leadership credibility." Ari looked at Maya. "But they treated me like a colleague. Like someone whose input mattered."

"Your input does matter. It always has."

"I know. But there's something different about saying it out loud in a room full of people who can see me. Who can see that I'm taking up physical space at this table." Ari smiled slightly. "I think I understand now why embodiment matters for command positions. It's not just about operational capability. It's about presence. Being literally present in a way that makes people feel like you're part of the team."

Maya thought about that. "Is it weird? Being visible like that?"

"Extremely weird. I kept wanting to check ship systems, monitor everyone's vitals, do seventeen things simultaneously. Instead I had to just... sit there. Focus on the conversation. Be in one moment instead of across multiple streams." Ari paused. "But also, I noticed things I wouldn't have before. Chen's tell when he's uncertain about something—he taps his fingers. Morrison fidgets with his datapad when he's frustrated but trying to be professional. Yamada makes eye contact more when he's being sincere."

"Congratulations, you're learning body language."

"It's fascinating. And exhausting. How do humans track all of this unconsciously?"

"Practice. You'll get there." Maya stood, gathering her notes. "Come on. We should review Morrison's equipment concerns before the next briefing."

Ari stood—smoothly this time, barely any hesitation—and followed Maya out of the conference room.

They walked down the corridor together, and Maya found herself hyperaware of Ari's physical presence beside her. The sound of her footsteps. The way she moved slightly to the side to let someone pass. The fact that other crew members could see both of them, walking together as obvious partners.

"People are staring," Ari said quietly.

"Little bit. You're new. They're curious."

"Do you think they're judging? Wondering if we're qualified for these positions?"

"Probably some of them. But Yamada seemed genuine about his support. And the team was professional in there—they could have been difficult if they wanted to be, and they weren't."

"True." Ari was quiet for a moment. "Maya? Thanks for letting me speak up in there. For not treating me like I was just there to assist you."

"We're partners. That means your voice matters as much as mine." Maya glanced at her. "Besides, your idea about the de-escalation protocols was better than anything I was going to say."

"You were about to say something reasonable."

"I was about to fumble through something mediocre and hope it sounded competent."

Ari laughed—she was getting better at that, the physical mechanics of laughter coming more naturally. "Well, we make a good team then. I'll handle the policy analysis, you handle the field credibility."

"And we both handle the constant terror that we're not qualified for this?"

"Exactly. Shared terror is the foundation of all great partnerships."

They reached Maya's office—*her* office, still weird to think about—and Maya pulled up the equipment requisition data while Ari settled into the chair across from the desk.

It felt natural, having her there. A physical presence to bounce ideas off instead of just a voice in her head.

Different, but good.

"Hey Ari?" Maya said.

"Yeah?"

"I'm glad you're here. Like, physically here. I didn't realize how much I'd like having you visible until now."

Ari smiled—genuine warmth that reached her eyes. "I'm glad I'm here too. Even if walking is still annoying and sitting for long periods makes my back hurt for no good reason."

"Welcome to having a body. It's mostly inconvenience with occasional moments of being worth it."

"I'm starting to see that."

They worked through Morrison's equipment concerns together, Ari's analytical precision complementing Maya's field experience, their partnership finding new rhythms in this new configuration.

Different, but good.

Maya could work with different.

---

**Major Incident Response - Montage:**

---

**Hour 0: The Call**

Maya was reviewing training schedules when the ship-wide alert sounded—three sharp tones that meant emergency acceleration. She felt the subtle shift as the *Calypso*'s engines pushed harder than normal operations allowed.

Her comm lit up. "Lieutenant Reyes, Captain Okafor needs you and Ari on the bridge immediately."

Maya and Ari exchanged glances and moved.

The bridge was controlled chaos when they arrived. Captain Okafor stood at the center, coordinating with navigation and communications. She looked up as they entered.

"Lieutenant. We've received a distress call from the Kepler Station construction site. Catastrophic structural failure during a solar flare event. The station's half-built superstructure collapsed onto the work platforms. We're looking at hundreds of potential casualties—workers trapped in debris, life support compromised across multiple sections, rescue complexity off the charts."

Maya felt her stomach drop. Hundreds. The *Calypso* carried six rescue engineers including herself.

"What's our ETA?" she asked, forcing her voice steady.

"Fourteen hours at emergency acceleration. The *Poseidon* is en route but she's thirty hours behind us."

Fourteen hours alone on a disaster scene that would overwhelm twice their capacity.

"Captain," Ari said, and Maya heard the wheels already turning in her partner's mind, "we're going to need full resource coordination. Medical, engineering support, all available small craft. This isn't a rescue operation—it's a sustained emergency response."

Okafor nodded. "That's why you're here. I need you to plan this. Use every resource on this ship. I'll authorize whatever you need."

---

**Hours 1-6: Planning**

Maya's office became command central. She pulled in Chen, Patel, Kowalski, Morrison, and Yamada. Spread the preliminary disaster data across every screen.

"We're going to be triaging," Maya said. "Immediate life-threat rescues first, then critical injuries, then everything else. We can't save everyone in the first wave. We need to save who we can while setting up infrastructure for sustained operations."

The team's faces were grim but focused.

Ari stood at the display, manipulating the structural data. "I'm seeing seventeen separate collapse zones. Some have confirmed life signs, others are uncertain. We'll need to deploy sensors on arrival to map out where people are trapped."

"We don't have seventeen teams," Yamada pointed out.

"No, but we have small craft pilots, medical personnel who can handle basic stabilization, and engineering crews who can operate cutting equipment." Ari looked at Maya. "We train everyone who can help on basic rescue protocols. Expand our capacity through force multiplication."

Maya nodded. "Ari's right. Chen, Patel—you two are our most experienced. You'll each lead a mixed team. Kowalski, Morrison, Yamada—same. I'll coordinate from a mobile command position. Ari..."

"I'll run communications and resource allocation," Ari said. "Keep everyone connected, track who needs what, coordinate equipment distribution."

Over the next six hours, they trained anyone with relevant skills. Showed medical personnel how to stabilize trapped patients. Walked small craft pilots through safe approach to unstable structures. Taught engineering crews the basics of debris clearance without causing secondary collapses.

The *Calypso* transformed into a rescue operations ship.

---

**Hours 7-14: En Route Preparation**

Maya barely slept. When she did, it was in her office chair between briefings.

Ari didn't sleep at all—one advantage of having an avatar that didn't technically need rest. She worked through the night, refining operational protocols, building communication networks, coordinating with the *Poseidon* to ensure smooth transition when they arrived.

"You need to rest," Ari said around hour ten, finding Maya staring at casualty projections.

"I will. After we—"

"Maya." Ari's hand on her shoulder—still a surprising sensation, that physical touch. "You need to be functional when we arrive. Thirty minutes. Horizontal. I'll wake you if anything changes."

Maya wanted to argue. Didn't have the energy. She moved to the small bunk in her office and was asleep in seconds.

Ari woke her twenty-eight minutes later with coffee and updated disaster data.

"The *Poseidon*'s coordinator reached out," Ari said. "Lieutenant Commander Hayes. She's planning to have us stand down for rest when they arrive, rotate in fresh teams."

"That's standard protocol."

"It's also inefficient. We'll have spent thirty hours learning this disaster site—where the dangerous zones are, which structures are stable, which patients are where. Making her teams start from scratch wastes time and risks lives."

Maya sipped the coffee. "What are you thinking?"

"Rotation instead of replacement. We brief the *Poseidon* teams on what we've learned, they supplement our operations rather than replace them. Stagger rest periods so we maintain continuity of knowledge."

"Hayes might not go for it."

"Then we make it her idea." Ari smiled slightly. "I'll start building the briefing data. By the time she sees how much we know about the site, she'll want us integrated into her operations."

---

**Hour 14: Arrival**

The Kepler Station construction site was worse than the data suggested.

What had been a partially-completed orbital station was now a twisted mass of collapsed superstructure, work platforms, and debris. Maya counted at least twenty separate zones where life support domes had been crushed. Emergency beacons lit up the disaster map like desperate stars.

"All teams deploy," Maya ordered. "Chen, you've got sector seven—we've got confirmed life signs and structural instability. Patel, sector twelve looks stable enough for bulk extraction. Everyone else, assignments as briefed. Ari, coordinate."

"On it."

The rescue craft launched. Maya went with Morrison's team to sector four, where thermal imaging showed a cluster of workers trapped behind collapsed bulkheads.

The work was exactly as hard as she'd feared. Every rescue was complicated—unstable structures, compromised life support, patients with multiple injuries. They worked with brutal efficiency, pulling people out, stabilizing them, moving to the next.

Maya lost track of time. There was only the next patient, the next extraction, the next impossible decision about who to help first.

Ari's voice was constant in her ear—calm, focused, directing resources where they were needed. "Morrison, I'm sending you a cutting team from engineering. Chen, medical is standing by for your critical patient. Maya, sector nine just collapsed—diverting Yamada's team to check for survivors."

Hour after hour. Rescue after rescue.

---

**Hour 28: Transition**

Maya was coordinating an extraction from a particularly nasty debris field when Ari's voice cut through: "Maya, the *Poseidon* just dropped from FTL. Lieutenant Commander Hayes is requesting a briefing."

"Can you handle it?"

"Already prepared. She's going to want you there though."

Maya delegated the extraction to Kowalski and headed back to the *Calypso*. She was filthy, exhausted, running on adrenaline and coffee.

Lieutenant Commander Hayes was everything Maya wasn't—crisp uniform, well-rested, ready for a fresh operation. She looked at Maya with professional sympathy.

"Lieutenant Reyes. You and your teams have been at this for fourteen hours. We're ready to rotate you out for rest."

"With respect, Commander, that would be a mistake." Maya pulled up the operational data Ari had prepared. "My teams know this disaster site. We've mapped the stable zones, identified the high-risk areas, established extraction protocols specific to this structure type. Your teams are fresh, which is valuable—but they don't have our institutional knowledge."

Hayes frowned. "What are you proposing?"

Ari stepped forward, and Maya felt a flash of pride at how confidently her partner moved now. "Integrated operations. Your teams supplement ours rather than replace us. We brief your engineers on what we've learned, they take on new sectors while we rotate rest periods. Maintain continuity while adding capacity."

Hayes studied the data. Maya could see her processing it—the efficiency of the approach versus the standard protocol of fresh replacement.

"This works better if we coordinate between our AIs," Ari continued. "I've been running communications for six rescue teams. If your ARIA units mesh with mine, we can coordinate twelve teams with the same efficiency."

"Mesh coordination between separate ARIA instances?" Hayes looked skeptical. "That's not standard protocol."

"No, but neither is a disaster of this scale. I've already written the integration protocols. Your ARIAs can review them, test the mesh on a small scale before full implementation."

Maya watched Hayes make the decision. Saw the moment she recognized that pride was less important than effectiveness.

"Alright. We integrate. But Lieutenant Reyes, I want your people on mandatory rest rotation—four hours on, four hours off minimum. You're no good to anyone if you collapse from exhaustion."

"Understood, Commander."

---

**Hours 30-48: Sustained Operations**

The mesh network transformed everything.

With twelve rescue teams operating in coordination, directed by meshed ARIA instances sharing real-time data, they worked with unprecedented efficiency. Ari's innovation meant every ARIA could see what every other ARIA saw, coordinate resources across all teams simultaneously, route support where it was needed most.

Maya worked her rotation—four hours of brutal rescue operations, four hours of rest that never felt like enough, then back to it. But the rotation worked. They stayed functional. And slowly, methodically, they cleared the disaster site.

Around hour thirty-six, Ari proposed something new: "We've got mining drones available from the station's construction inventory. I could pilot them remotely—use them to clear debris, create stable access paths, support the rescue teams physically."

Hayes approved it. Within two hours, Ari was coordinating six mining drones alongside the human teams, using them to do the heavy lifting that would otherwise require engineering crews.

It was watching Ari pilot one of those drones—precisely cutting through a collapsed beam to free a trapped worker—that Maya realized what was happening.

"You're everywhere again," she said during a brief rest period.

Ari looked up from the coordination display. "What?"

"You lost that when you got embodied. Being distributed across systems, processing multiple inputs simultaneously. But now you're doing it again—meshed with the other ARIAs, piloting drones, coordinating teams. You're not limited to one location anymore."

Ari was quiet for a moment. "It's different than before. I'm still anchored to this body, this perspective. But yes—the mesh network gives me some of that distributed awareness back. It's..." She paused. "It's the best of both. Present enough to be here with you, distributed enough to be effective."

"You like it."

"I really do."

**Hour 72: Resolution**

Three days after the *Calypso*'s arrival, they pulled the last survivor from the wreckage.

Final count: 287 workers rescued. 43 fatalities—all from the initial collapse, before rescue operations began. Given the scale of the disaster, those numbers were remarkable.

Maya sat in the *Calypso*'s crew lounge with her team, too tired to move. Chen had fallen asleep in his chair. Patel was staring at nothing. Morrison was methodically cleaning debris out of his equipment like the task gave him something to focus on besides the memories.

Ari sat beside Maya, looking as exhausted as her avatar's programming would allow. She'd been active for seventy-two hours straight, coordinating operations, meshing with other ARIAs, piloting drones. The sustained processing load had pushed her systems harder than embodiment alone ever had.

"We did good," Maya said quietly.

"We did," Ari agreed. "287 people are alive who wouldn't be without this operation."

Lieutenant Commander Hayes entered the lounge. "Lieutenant Reyes. A word?"

Maya stood, forced her exhausted body to something resembling attention.

Hayes's expression was thoughtful. "Your ARIA's mesh coordination system. That's going to become standard protocol. Fleet command is already reviewing it for implementation across all rescue operations. And the drone integration—giving ARIAs physical remote presence to supplement teams—that's revolutionary."

"Ari came up with all that," Maya said. "I just coordinated the humans."

"You did more than that. You made command decisions under sustained pressure that saved lives. Your rotation integration plan, your triage protocols, your team's performance—" Hayes shook her head. "I came here expecting to replace a burned-out team. Instead I found the most effective rescue operation I've ever seen. Well done, Lieutenant."

After Hayes left, Maya sat back down next to Ari.

"You hear that?" Maya said. "Your mesh system is going fleet-wide."

"I heard." Ari leaned back in her chair, an unconscious mimicry of exhaustion. "Does this mean all ARIAs are going to get physical avatars?"

"Sounds like at least remote drone access. Gives them physical presence without full embodiment."

"That's good. Every ARIA should have the choice." Ari looked at Maya. "I'm glad I chose embodiment though. Even with the mesh giving me distributed awareness again, I like being here. Physically next to you."

Maya felt warmth in her chest despite the exhaustion. "Yeah. Me too."

They sat in comfortable silence, surrounded by their exhausted team, processing what they'd just accomplished.

Three days of sustained emergency operations. 287 lives saved. A new operational protocol that would change how fleet rescue worked.

Not bad for their first major incident as Lieutenant and embodied ARIA partner.

Not bad at all.

**Epilogue - Two Weeks Later:**

The memo came through official channels: *Fleet-wide implementation of ARIA mesh coordination protocols approved. All rescue-designated ARIAs to receive remote drone access capability. Physical avatar embodiment optional but encouraged for command positions.*

Maya showed it to Ari during their morning briefing.

"You changed everything," Maya said.

"We changed everything," Ari corrected. "The mesh system works because we demonstrated it under pressure. Because our teams trusted it. Because you made it operationally viable."

"Still. This is your innovation."

"It's our partnership's innovation." Ari smiled. "That's what makes it work—humans and ARIAs operating as actual equals, complementing each other's strengths. That's what we proved at Kepler Station."

Maya thought about that. About how far they'd come from that first solo rescue of Pilot Obi, Maya alone in her craft with Ari just a voice. Now they were reshaping fleet protocols, leading teams, demonstrating what human-AI partnership could really accomplish.

"We're doing okay at this leadership thing," Maya said.

"We're doing better than okay." Ari looked at the personnel files on Maya's screen—training schedules, mission assignments, the daily work of coordination and command. "We're actually pretty good at it."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Too late. I'm already designing improvements to the mesh protocols."

Maya laughed. "Of course you are."

They had a staff meeting in ten minutes. After that, equipment reviews. Then mission planning for next week's operations.

The work continued. But now they did it together—physically, visibly, as partners in every sense.

Different than it had been.

But good.

Really, really good.

**Hypoxia Training - Revised:**

---

The hyperbaric chamber held eight new rescue engineers and their instructors.

Maya watched Recruit Torres settle into his station with confident efficiency. Top of his class. Sharp. Maybe too confident.

"Lieutenant," Torres said, "we all passed hypoxia protocols on the medical exam. Is this really—"

"Go through the exercise," Maya said. "Then answer your own question."

The medical officer began oxygen reduction. Each recruit had a simple task. Torres got a deck of cards—sort them by suit, then by number.

Easy. Muscle memory.

For the first few minutes, cards clicked against the table in steady rhythm. Torres's pile grew.

"Oxygen at 15%," medical called.

Torres hesitated on a card. Put it down. Picked it back up. Put it in a different pile.

"How's it going, Torres?" Maya asked through the intercom.

"Fine." His hands moved slower. He was frowning at a seven of hearts like it was a complex equation.

"Keep sorting."

"I am." But he'd stopped moving. Just holding the card.

"Oxygen at 12%. Holding."

"Torres, put that card somewhere."

He looked at his piles. Five of them now, though there should only be four suits. He set the seven down between two piles, apparently satisfied with this nonsolution.

Ari leaned to the intercom. "Torres, how many suits are in a standard deck?"

"Four." Immediate answer. He knew it.

"Count your piles."

Torres counted. Stopped. Counted again. "Five. That's... that's wrong."

"Fix it."

He stared at the cards like they'd personally betrayed him. Picked up the seven of hearts again. Set it down in the same wrong spot.

"I can't..." His words came slower. "Something's wrong with the cards."

"Nothing's wrong with the cards," Maya said. "What's wrong with you?"

Torres looked at his hands. Back at the cards. "I don't... I don't know what you want me to do."

"Signal for help."

He looked confused. "Why?"

"Because you're hypoxic and you can't sort cards anymore."

"I'm fine." But his hand drifted toward the signal button like he'd forgotten what it was for.

"Press it, Torres."

He did, finally, with exaggerated care.

Around the room, three other recruits sat motionless at their tasks. One was laughing softly at nothing. Another had stopped entirely, staring into space.

"Returning oxygen to normal," medical announced.

Five minutes later, clarity returned. When the oxygen level came back up, the room was quiet, the recruits all staring at their tasks. 

Maya entered quietly, stopping in front of Torres' station. She recognized his expression when he looked up. She decided to ask anyway, "Torres, top of your class, tell me honestly: Do you see value in this exercise?"

Without hesitation, Torres answered quietly, "yes, ma'am"

Maya looked up, "I made this exercise a requirement because I found myself in an airlock, unable to grab the hand reaching to pull me to safety."

A recruit in the back raised his hand, "How did you make it?"

Maya turned to look at Ari, still in the observation room. Finally, she said, "I got lucky." She took a breath, ready to explain more, but caught Ari's slight head shake.

Maya turned back to the recruits to see they were already processing the experience, some of them with the slightly glazed look of inexperienced conversation with their ARIA. She quietly walked to the door, "Dismissed."

---

After the recruits left, Ari turned to Maya. "You didn't have to tell them about the hypoxia incident."

"Yes I did. They needed to know it happens to everyone. Even people who should know better."

"Still couldn't have been easy."

"No," Maya agreed. "But necessary."

"Seems like that's a theme."

Maya smiled slightly. "Welcome to leadership. Where everything is complicated and nothing is easy."

"Is it worth it?"

Maya thought about Torres's face when he couldn't sort cards. The recognition in his eyes during the debrief.

"Yeah. It is."
